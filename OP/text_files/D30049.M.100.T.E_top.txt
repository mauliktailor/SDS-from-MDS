North Korea agreed to receive a U.S. delegation to discuss concerns about an underground site feared to house a nuclear weapons program.
South Korea supports the U.S. and calls for full access to the site by U.S. inspectors.
North Korea denies the concerns and proposes a $300 mil payment to visit the site.

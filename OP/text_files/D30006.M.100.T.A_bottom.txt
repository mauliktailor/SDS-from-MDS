In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.
They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.
The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.

Sweden's deadliest fire occurred on Halloween when a dance hall in Goteborg, filled with teenagers, burst into flames.
The cause is not known, but the hall, approved for 150, contained as many as 400 and one of the two exits was blocked.
Sixty were killed and between 150 and 173 injured.
Most were immigrants or their children and represented 19 nationalities.

1998's Nobel prize for literature went to a Portuguese for the 1st time, imaginative novelist Jose Saramago, long a candidate.
Portugal celebrated but the Vatican called him a communist and anti-religious.
The meaning of Nobel's advice to honor "literature that works in an ideal direction" is unclear.

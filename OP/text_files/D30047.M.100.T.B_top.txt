NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.
They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.
Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.
The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.

Galina Starovoitova, a liberal Russian lawmaker, doctor, mother, grandmother and Presidential hopeful, was mourned as a martyr and buried beside other heroes in St. Petersburg.
She had been shot four days earlier by two, still unknown, assailants.
Her press aide, also shot, was recovering under heavy guard.
The death looked like a contract killing, all too common now in Russia.

A category 5 storm, Hurricane Mitch roared across the northwest Caribbean with 180 mph winds across a 350-mile front that devastated the mainland and islands of Central America.
Although the force of the storm diminished, at least 8,000 people died from wind, waves and flood damage.
The greatest losses were in Honduras where some 6,076 people perished.

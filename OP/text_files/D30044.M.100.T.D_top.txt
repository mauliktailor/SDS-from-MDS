An international incident resulted after the arrest in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
An armed struggle has ensued since the PKK was formed in 1978, and nearly 37,000 died.
Turkey wants Ocalan extradited but Italy is reluctant since Turkey still has the death penalty.

On Tuesday, Palestinians celebrated the inauguration of the new Gaza International Airport as part of the latest Mideast peace accord.
It will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians have ever had out of the Gaza Strip.
An Egypt Air plane was the first to land, followed by an emotional touchdown of the first Palestinian plane.

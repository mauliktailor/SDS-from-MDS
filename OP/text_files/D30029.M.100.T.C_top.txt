Gale-force winds and high seas struck the 155 participants in Australia's Sydney to Hobart yacht race.
One sailor, Glyn Charles, who was swept off the yacht Sword of Orion, is presumed drowned and two seamen on the Business Post Naiad were killed.
Search and rescue efforts were stretched to the limit also as three yachts turned up missing.

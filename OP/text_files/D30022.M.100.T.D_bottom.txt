China continues to arrest dissidents even as it prepares to sign a UN human rights treaty and to host the first visit by a British PM in seven years.
The dissident China Democracy Party believes it is legal to challenge the communists' power monopoly, but the PRC cites a "grab-bag" section of the criminal code making almost any political activity illegal.
The US has protested the arrests.

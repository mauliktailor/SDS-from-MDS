While China plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at the U.N., it is still harassing and arresting human rights campaigners.
Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms.
Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests.

South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30.
This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process.
Those named for prosecution were warned before the release.
Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed.

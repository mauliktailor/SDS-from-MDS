In December 1998 a story broke that relatives of International Olympic Committee (IOC) members had received $400,000 in scholarships from promoters of Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
The IOC immediately ordered a top-level investigation.
Senior IOC official Marc Hodler called the scholarships a "bribe".

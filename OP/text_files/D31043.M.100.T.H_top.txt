Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president.
Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.
It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.

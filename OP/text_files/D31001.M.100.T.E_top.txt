South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report.
Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights.
The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame.

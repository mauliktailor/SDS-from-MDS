Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering.
President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government.
A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding.
Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's.

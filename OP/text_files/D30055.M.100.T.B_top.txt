Italy's Communist Refounding Party rejected Prime Minister Prodi's proposed 1999 budget.
Loss of the party's support put his 2.5-year coalition at risk.
The proposed budget was needed to meet terms for the Jan. 1 switch to the euro currency.
Prodi met with President Scalfaro and Parliament, trying to save his government.

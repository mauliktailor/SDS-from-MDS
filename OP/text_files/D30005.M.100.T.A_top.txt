After the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa the U.S. on Aug. 20, 1998 made missile attacks on an Al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan tenuously linked to Osama bin Laden.
In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden.

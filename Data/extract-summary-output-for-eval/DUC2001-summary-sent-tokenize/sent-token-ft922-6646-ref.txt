Abstract:Following a 1990 embargo by Serbia, Slovenian exports to the former Yugoslavia fell by 85%.
Slovene officials say for capital inflows to increase Slovenia must re-establish those trade links, which accounted for 30% of Slovene exports.
Slovenia is too small to attract large amounts of foreign investment to foster growth.
It recently signed trade agreements with Croatia and Macedonia and is seeking new markets among EC countries.
Slovenian industrial production sharply dropped and unemployment rose to 11%, but inflation fell to 5% thanks to the Slovene central bank's strong monetary policy.
Enterprises will need to become more competitive after privatization, now being discussed by Parliament.

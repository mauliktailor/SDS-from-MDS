Abstract:Calm waters of Prince William Sound stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in US history.
The spill of 11.3M gallons occurred when the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef 25 miles from Valdez, Alaska.
Exxon officials planned to pump oil remaining on the Valdez onto another Exxon tanker.
A spill of this size in a complex environment promises to be a cleanup nightmare.
The Valdez had been loaded at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. with crude from the Trans-Alaska pipeline.
Alyeska must now operate at reduced rate and its capacity would allow nine days of operation before it would shut down.
Valdez relies on fishing, oil, and tourism.

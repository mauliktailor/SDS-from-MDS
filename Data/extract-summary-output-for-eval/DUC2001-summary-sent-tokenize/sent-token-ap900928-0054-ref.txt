Abstract:
Ben Johnson spent his homecoming without the gold medal and hero's welcome.
On the flight from Seoul to New York he denied using drugs even though Olympic officials said the test results were indisputable.
On his flight from New York to Canada, he spent the entire time in the cockpit to avoid reporters.
A parade in his adopted home town in Canada was canceled and promoters backed out of deals with the sprinter.
Johnson's family and friends denied that he took steroids.
Johnson's fans were disappointed but hundreds of Canadians rallied to the sprinter's side.

Abstract:A lightning-sparked fire in Utah's Zion National Park spread out of control to 1,000 acres Tuesday, but rain helped firefighters hold the line on a 2,000-acre forest fire in Montana and two other major fires in Wyoming.
A fire that scorched 1,130 acres in and around the Hiawatha Nation Forest in Michigan was linked to a vehicle exhaust pipe.
Hundreds of small grass and brush fires were reported over the July 4 weekend, some caused by fireworks, in various parts of the country.
Kentucky's Division of Forestry reported 85 fires burned 1,267 acres in the first four days of July.

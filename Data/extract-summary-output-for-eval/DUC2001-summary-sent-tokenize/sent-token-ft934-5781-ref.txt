Abstract:The U.S. Congress has finally passed the Brady Bill after a long struggle.
The bill requires a five-day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun.
The Brady Bill, the recent ban on the purchase of assault weapons, and other pending bills are being viewed by some anti-gun proponents as an indication that the tide has turned in favor of gun control.
Opponents of gun control, led by the National Rifle Association and citing their authority as the Second Amendment to the Constitution, continue their opposition to all forms of gun control.

Abstract:Mexico's President has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for "the solar eclipse of the century" on July 11, 1991.
It will pass through 14 of Mexico's 31 states.
The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
Most hotels along the route are already full.
Tourism officials are seeking private homes, campgrounds, schools, auditoriums and even ships to house the expected influx.
Some 13,500 amateur and professional astronomers from around the world have confirmed reservations.
Baja
California Sur, due to its cloudless days, is considered the best place to watch.

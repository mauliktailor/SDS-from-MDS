Abstract:On Friday, Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a European-Community-brokered cease-fire that called for federal troops in Slovenia to return to barracks, a three-month delay in carrying out Slovenia's and Croatia's independence declarations, and installation of the Croatian federal president.
Slovenian insistence on approval by its parliament caused Serbian president Milosevic to delay the installation.
On Saturday the Yugoslav army ordered Slovenia to halt attacks against federal forces or face decisive military action, confirming fears that the army is acting outside government control.
Preparations for hostilities are widespread.
Fighting killed 40 people.
Deputy Secretary of State Eagleburger said the US might consider recognizing Croatia and Slovenia.

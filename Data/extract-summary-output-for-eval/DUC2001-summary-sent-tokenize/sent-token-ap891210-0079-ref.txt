Abstract:Associated Press has tracked the 1988 $3.9 billion drought relief package intended to save Midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy.
While the program did assist farmers in the upper Great Plains who needed it, AP found that the election year payments went far beyond.
Congress added hail and flood damage to the package, and loose regulations and lax enforcement further spread the money.
By November, one- quarter of all American farmers, some of whom enjoyed good crops at higher prices, had collected damage money.
AP found some growers got drought aid and crop insurance payments, and then replanted for a successful harvest.
Some payments went to banks, corporations, churches and even local governments.

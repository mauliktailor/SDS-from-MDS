Abstract:Investors are being sought for a diamond mine in Zimbabwe which De Beers discovered in 1975 but gave up rights to in 1991 because of the political situation and failing to reach a marketing agreement with the Zimbabwe government.
De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving and all documentation about deposits disappeared.
Mr. Robin Baxter- Brown, one of the new joint owners of River Ranch Mine, started his career with De Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience.
The deposit is estimated as 17.5 million tonnes, 60% of gem quality, and there is likely another deposit nearby.
Mining began in March.

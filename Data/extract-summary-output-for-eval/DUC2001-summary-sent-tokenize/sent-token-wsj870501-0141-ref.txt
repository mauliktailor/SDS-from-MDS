Abstract:The Shining Path is now gaining support among farmers in the jungles of the Upper Huallaga Valley.
From July 1984 to December 1985 this area was under a state of emergency and controlled by the army, which reportedly collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from drug lords.
When President Garcia lifted the state of emergency, the army lost control and the Shining Path moved in.
Reportedly, the guerrillas are demanding one-fifth of the farmer's coca crop in return for protection.
The Shining Path is organizing self-defense groups to oppose the anti-drug police and coca-eradication personnel.

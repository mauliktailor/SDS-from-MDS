Abstract:
The National Governors Association presented a welfare reform plan to President Reagan that would require welfare recipients to do something productive to earn their benefits, be it completing school, receiving vocational training or holding a job.
The governors' proposal will cost $2 billion per year in addition to the $100 billion now spent on poverty programs.
Reagan doesn't like their plan's national minimum benefit level, which he believes will undercut each states' ability to set its own standard.
Several states have already launched successful work-for-welfare programs, thus encouraging many other states to try something similar.
Reform consensus seems to be building.

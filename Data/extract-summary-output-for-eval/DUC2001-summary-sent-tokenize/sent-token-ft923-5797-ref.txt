Abstract:While workers fanned out across Louisiana yesterday for a massive rebuilding effort after the destruction caused by Hurricane Andrew, officials in Florida complained of delays in supplying critical assistance to thousands of people in need.
Transportation Secretary Andrew Card promised "dramatic" improvements.
In Dade County Florida it was reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one resident in eight, affecting a quarter of a million people.
The government estimated that it would cost $20-30 billion to rebuild and care for displaced residents in Florida.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was setting aside $77 million to help Louisiana recover.

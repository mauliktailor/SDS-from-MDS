Abstract:From a helicopter, the Alaskan beach appears untouched by the worst oil spill in US history but hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under the surface.
A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, dead birds no longer wash up onto the beach but thousands were killed earlier.
Exxon notes that the spill did not wipe out any species and that surviving animals can rebuild populations.
But the US Fish and Wildlife Service says that could take 70 years.
Joseph Hazelwood is on trial for drunken driving of the vessel as captain.
Criminal indictments have been issued against Exxon and they also face more than 150 civil lawsuits.

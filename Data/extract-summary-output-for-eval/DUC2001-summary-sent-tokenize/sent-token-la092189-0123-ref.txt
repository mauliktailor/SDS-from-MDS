Abstract:A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 on board exploded in the air, possibly from a terrorist bomb, in Niger, Northern Africa.
All aboard presumably died, including the wife of the American Ambassador to Chad.
Intelligence specialists in Washington believe the bombing may be in retaliation against France for its recent Lebanese activities.
France has been trying to broker a settlement there between Christian and pro-Syrian forces.
The DC-10 was owned by the French airline UTA and crashed Tuesday, September 19, after taking off from N'Djamena, Chad.
Anonymous callers claimed responsibility on behalf of the Islamic Jihad.

Abstract:William Gray, a hurricane expert, predicts more and fiercer storms in the Atlantic.
He expects six this year, average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade.
Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the equator, and winds for El Nino periods do no allow for predictions of when or where hurricanes will occur.
He predicted four in 1987, three actually occurred; four for four in 1986, seven for seven in 1985 five for seven in 1984.
Drought in West Africa in the 1970s and 1980s robbed storm systems of moisture needed to escalate storms into hurricanes.

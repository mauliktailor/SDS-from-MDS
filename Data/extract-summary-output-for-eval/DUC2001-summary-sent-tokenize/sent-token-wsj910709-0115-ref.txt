Abstract:The upcoming Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas' qualifications and fitness to serve on the Supreme Court will be a lesson for everyone.
His life will be viewed as living proof that a black man from the impoverished South can rise to the heights of the Supreme Court.
His supporters say that he is an example of one who relied on the love of his extended family, and worked hard in rising from a humble beginning to a position of prominence.
It is anticipated that his detractors will acknowledge that, but will maintain that he was helped along by the same government aid that he would deny to others.

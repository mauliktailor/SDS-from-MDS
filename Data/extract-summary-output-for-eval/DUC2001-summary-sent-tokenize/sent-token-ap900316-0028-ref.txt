Abstract:The National Centers for Disease Control reported data on tuberculosis showing 7,720 new cases in whites, 8,289 in blacks, 3,367 in Hispanics and another 2,371 in Asians and Pacific Islanders.
This represents a reversal in a trend in which tuberculosis was declining.
Much of the regression is caused by the occurrence of tuberculosis in AIDA patients.
Tuberculosis was up 9.1 percent in blacks and 17.6 percent in Hispanics, two groups with proportionally higher rates of AIDS.
More than 115,00 Americans were being treated for tuberculosis, about 20,000 new patients and another 20,00 labeled high risk and in preventive therapy.

Abstract:
Some members of congress argue that the Second Amendment's "..right to bear arms".
precludes any legislation designed to control arms.
Another view is that the Second Amendment provides a solid basis for effective gun control legislation.
Justification for this point of view is based on an interpretation of the Amendment's wording in the light of the situation existing in 1792.
For purposes of gun control today, it would mean that Congress require owners to register their firearms with the National Guard.
This would provide the necessary information concerning owners as required by the Brady Bill and other gun control legislation.

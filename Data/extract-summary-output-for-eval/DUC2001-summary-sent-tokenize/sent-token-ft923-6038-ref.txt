Abstract:Hurricane Andrew made landfall late Tuesday night some 60 miles southwest of New Orleans smashing its way through largely rural Cajun country.
The hurricane landed with winds of about 120 mph, causing severe damage in small coastal centers, but sparing New Orleans.
The storm lost force as it moved north over land and by yesterday afternoon was downgraded to a tropical storm with windspeeds less than 75 mph.
The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's oil refining industry.
A senior member of Lloyd's said yesterday insurers' losses in Florida are likely to be less than $1 billion, well below earlier predictions.

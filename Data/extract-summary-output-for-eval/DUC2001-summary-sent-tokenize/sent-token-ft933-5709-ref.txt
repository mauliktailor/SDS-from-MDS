Abstract:President Clinton chose William Daley, son of legendary Chicago political boss Richard Daley, to head a task force to get NAFTA ratified.
Smooth-talking Daley has important connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organized labor.
He is experienced at the back-room political arm-twisting required to sway moderate Democrats in a divided Congress.
Recent polls show 2/3 of Americans oppose NAFTA.
Grassroots opposition fueled by labor groups is growing.
Clinton reserved his own support until environmental and labor side agreements were reached.
The agreement will unravel if it is not ratified by Jan 1.
The battle for congressional support will be fierce.

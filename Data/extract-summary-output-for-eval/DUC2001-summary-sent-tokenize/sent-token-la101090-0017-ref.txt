Abstract:Ross Baker equates term limits to burning down the house to get rid of the rats.
He believe the recurring temptation to legislate vengeance on adversaries will backfire.
Oklahoma has limited state lawmakers to 12 years' service.
This will create more amateurs who will be controlled by governors and bureaucrats and more vulnerable to corruption.
Additionally, office holders will not have a stake in their job and will be more concerned with their next job.
Lobbyists and legislative staffs will be celebrating the guaranteed influx of inexperienced office holders.
Baker considers term limits illogical and wrong, and an insult to the voters.

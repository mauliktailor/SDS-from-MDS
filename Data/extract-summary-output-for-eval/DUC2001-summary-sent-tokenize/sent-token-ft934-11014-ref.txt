Abstract:The Clinton administration has given approval for pilot welfare plans in Wisconsin and Georgia.
The Wisconsin plan cuts off cash payments after two years but continues food stamps and health care.
The Georgia plan does not have a time limit for benefits, but reduces payments to able-bodied adults who refuse offers of work and denies increased benefits to long-time welfare mothers who have more children.
The federal government, which must grant waivers from normal welfare rules, is also considering requests from Florida and Vermont for time limits on benefits.
National welfare reform is delayed until the budget and healthcare reform are resolved.

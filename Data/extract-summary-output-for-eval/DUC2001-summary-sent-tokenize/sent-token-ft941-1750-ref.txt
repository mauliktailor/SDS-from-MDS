Abstract:Central American and Caribbean governments await a US statement on Caribbean basin market protection in the US and Canada, promised by President Clinton in talks last year.
Regional leaders fear Mexico could capture Caribbean-developed markets and investments could be diverted to Mexico.
Also, parity for a few exports would come at the price of investment treaties, intellectual property and workers' rights agreements, environmental legislation, democracy, etc.
A de facto extension of NAFTA is unlikely, given the opposition to the original NAFTA.
Some US congressmen propose putting all regional exports on a par with Mexico's for three years while future trade relationships are negotiated.

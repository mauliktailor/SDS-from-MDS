Abstract:1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the country.
One tornado in Kansas was the strongest since 1985.
Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes.
Studies of tornadoes indicate they are concentrated in regions for five or six year periods.
Parts of the Midwest, particularly Kansas and Missouri, seem to be entering such a trend.
However, because computers allow meteorologists to see more sources of data more clearly, warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated leading to fewer deaths.

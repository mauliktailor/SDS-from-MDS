Abstract:
In San Jose, the eclipse will begin at 10:10 a.m., peak at 11:20 and end at 12:34 p.m. Do not look at it through film negatives, a camera viewfinder or sunglasses.
Use special Mylar glasses or punch a hole in a piece of paper and look downward at the shadow.
You will sense the eclipse better from a mountaintop or from your roof.
Most of the Bay area is expected to be sunny.
However, it may still be foggy along the coast.
Do not look at the sun through the fog.
The next major eclipse will be in another 151 years.

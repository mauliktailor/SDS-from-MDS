Abstract:Anti-NAFTA demonstrators in Virginia said NAFTA undermines the constitution and judicial system by putting decision-making in the hands of international panels.
Virginia's tax base would be a concern as companies moved production to Mexico and placed downward pressure on wages.
Demonstrators published lists of business contributors to pro-NAFTA congressmen, and said President Clinton was buying off undecideds with promises of new projects in their districts.
One undecided congressman, a member of the armed services committee with many military in his district, expected to be influenced by NAFTA's foreign policy implications, but said if offered a decent project he might find it tough to say no.

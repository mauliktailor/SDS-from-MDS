Abstract:A United States Air Force B-52 bomber, assigned to the Strategic Air Command and based at K.I. Sawyer Airfield in Michigan, crashed today at 1:15 A.M. while practicing "touch-and-go" landings at its base.
The aircraft burst into flames.
None of the crew was burned, but all suffered injuries, with one in critical condition.
In recent B-52 crashes, two crewmembers were killed when their aircraft clipped a mesa in Arizona, and on February 14th of this year there were no injuries when a pilot overshot a runway in California.

Abstract:The Long Beach City Council has called for an investigation of an incident broadcast on NBC's national news Monday night.
A white policeman, Dickey, was filmed pushing an off-duty black policeman, Jackson, through a plate glass window.
Jackson and a companion were driving through a high-crime area of Long Beach when they were pulled over by Dickey.
Dickey started to search Jackson and when Jackson asked why he was being searched, Dickey unleashed a stream of profanity and ordered Jackson to put his hands behind his head.
When Jackson complied he was pushed through a plate-glass store window.

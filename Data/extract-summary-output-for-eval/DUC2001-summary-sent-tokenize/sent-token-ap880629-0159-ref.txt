Abstract:Two United States Air Force F-16 fighters, each carrying a single pilot crashed from the 50th Tactical Air Wing at Hahn, collided and exploded at 1:30 P.M. today.
The aircraft crashed near a populated area south of Mainz, but no one on the ground was injured.
The West German Police said one pilot was killed, but the Air Force did not confirm the death.
The crash came less than two hours after another F-16, this one from the 52nd Tactical Wing at Spangdahlen crashed into the Black Forest after that pilot ejected.

Abstract:A videotape being shown nationwide catches Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting nonviolent anti-abortion demonstrators.
They press fingers under their noses, dig their knuckles into demonstrators' necks, and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists.
The police call these techniques "pain-compliance".
Opponents call them torture.
Injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta.
Since then there have been charges of police brutality in San Diego, Pittsburgh, West Hartford, Conn., Boston, and Denver.
Last November 15, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force.

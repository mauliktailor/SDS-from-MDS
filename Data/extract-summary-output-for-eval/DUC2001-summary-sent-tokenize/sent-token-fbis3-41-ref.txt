Abstract:On 25 January, La Republica, a prominent anti-Fujimori daily, published a tract purported to be a genuine Shining Path statement approved by imprisoned Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman.
The paper contended that it wanted to provide Peruvians with peace proposal information, not released by the government.
The government had released letters from Guzman calling for peace talks in October 1993, claiming they represented an admission of political defeat and the government now had the initiative in confronting the guerrillas.
Media in Lima doubt these conclusions, claiming Guzman is no longer in control and is being used by Fujimori.

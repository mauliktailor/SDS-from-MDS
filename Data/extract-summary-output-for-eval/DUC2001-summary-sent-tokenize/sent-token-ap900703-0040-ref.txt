Abstract:After a Slovenian coalition of center-right parties trounced reform communists in the first free state elections held in Yugoslavia in 45 years, the new government unanimously proclaimed Slovenia's full sovereignty.
Slovenia would have an independent legal system, its own intelligence services, and would control armed forces stationed within the republic.
A new democratic constitution would be adopted within the next 12 months.
The new authorities say Slovenia will declare full independence if remaining republics do not accept its proposals for a confederation, vehemently opposed by Serbia.
Monday's proclamation may have been affected by a recent Serbian crackdown on Kosovo autonomy.

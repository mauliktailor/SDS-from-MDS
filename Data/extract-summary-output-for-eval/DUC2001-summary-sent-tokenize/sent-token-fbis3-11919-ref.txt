Abstract:The assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in March 1994 in Tijuana, Baja California prompted expressions of sympathy from neighboring countries.
Official condolences were sent to the Mexican government by the President of Colombia, the ruling party in El Salvador, and the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, all of whom also expressed their support for Mexico.
The Cuban Foreign Ministry expressed its shock and indignation at the incident.
Rival Mexican candidates sent regrets noting the threat politicians face when they appear at public rallies and that such violence was the result of "savage capitalism".

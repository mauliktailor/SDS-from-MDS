Abstract:Exxon crews finished pumping the remaining crude from the Exxon Valdez, preparing to refloat the vessel.
Exxon planned to pump air into the hold to aid in refloating the vessel.
They said that the oil-catching boom put around the ship after an 11 hour delay, could have touched off an explosion of gases from the oil.
The family of fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, said he wanted to surrender but awaits advice from counsel.
The state told fishermen it would not allow a herring season this year.
Ordinally, a harvest is usually worth about $12M. Sablefish and shrimp fisheries have also been closed.

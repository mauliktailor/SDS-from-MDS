Abstract:Dr.
William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University predicted that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above average.
Rainfall in the Sahel region of West Africa is the indicator he uses to predict hurricanes.
Winds moving across warm ocean air cause updrafts of air bearing sea water that turn into rain clouds.
In the absence of moisture, the storms quickly dissipate, but storms gather strength with additional moisture.
Comparing yearly rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Dr Gray found a striking correlation.
Dr Gray said climate changes in the Sahel result from natural weather cycles.

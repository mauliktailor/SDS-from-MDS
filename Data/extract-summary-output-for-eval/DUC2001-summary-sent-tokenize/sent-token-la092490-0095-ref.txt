Abstract:Two years after his suspension for drug use at the Seoul Olympics, sprinter Ben Johnson appeared before the press.
He was confident, bragging, and promising big things to come.
If he returns to the sport as a winner, all is forgiven said the assistant meet director for the Hamilton Games.
Johnson expressed little doubt that he could retain his 1988 form.
Johnson has passed four drug tests since his suspension and has a new coach.
The Canadian Olympic Association is expected to lift his ban.
Johnson will command high appearance fees ($60,000 in Stockholm) initially but later will be dependent on performance.

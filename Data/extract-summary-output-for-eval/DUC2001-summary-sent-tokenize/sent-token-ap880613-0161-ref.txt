Abstract:On Sunday, the Peruvian Police captured Osman Morote, the top military leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group.
Morote had arrived in Lima a week ago to coordinate terrorist attacks in Lima.
The Shining Path was founded by Abimael Guzman.
It is a splinter of the Peruvian Communist Party and is seeking to overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker state.
Eight years ago the group took up arms after conducting semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the Andean highlands for 10 years.
Guzman, not seen for years, still is recognized at the group's leader.

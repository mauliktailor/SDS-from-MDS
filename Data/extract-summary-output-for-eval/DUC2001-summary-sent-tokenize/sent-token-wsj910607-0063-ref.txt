Abstract:
Unlike many conventional systems for making loans in the world, making a microloan to a Third World small business entrepreneur is almost a guarantee of repayment.
Recipients want the security of a favorable credit rating.
These microloans cancel out the need to get involved with loan sharks.
Third world banks and large development organizations are making such loans as well, particularly when they discovered that the repayment rate by the poor is nearly 100 percent.
Some charitable organizations still prefer to make per-to-person sponsorships and the teaching of skills to improve the quality of life.

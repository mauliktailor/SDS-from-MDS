Abstract:President Clinton states that he is committed to "ending welfare as we know it".
He will base his reforms on the principle that welfare should not be a way of life.
His reform will focus on better implementation of the Family Support Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on NGA task-force work that he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
However, with the onset of recession, states' revenues are constrained while the number of welfare recipients has increased.
Therefore, few states are able to implement the Act's requirements for education or training.
Clinton will allow states to experiment with their own reforms.

Abstract:
In 1988 the nation's more than 700 tornadoes caused 32 deaths, down from 59 a year earlier and the long-term average of 99.
Meteorologists attribute the decline in deaths to increased public awareness of the storms.
1988 also witnessed the largest one-day outbreak of twisters in fourteen years when 57 tornadoes tore through four states on Mother's Day.
Few in winter, tornadoes generally increase in March leading to an April average of 109, a average May peak of 166 and tapering in June to an average of150.
The typical tornado is about 50 yards wide and travels about two miles on the ground.

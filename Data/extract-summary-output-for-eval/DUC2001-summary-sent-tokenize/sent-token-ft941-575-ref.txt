Abstract:The European Commission will tell Germany today that it will take legal action if Bonn attempts to unilaterally ban British beef for fear of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease".
The German health minister has been the prime mover for action against the UK.
The commission points out that the EU sets veterinary rules and that there is no scientific evidence linking BSE with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which affects humans.
British officials point out that they have taken strong measures to control BSE and that the EU single market will be disrupted unless all members stick to the scientific evidence.

Abstract:Prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing brush and trees that surround many Southern California neighborhoods, creating the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades.
Most vulnerable in the 1990 season are the chaparral-covered foothills and mountain canyon slopes beside densely developed residential districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs.
The area's average rainfall is 14.93 inches.
Only 6.15 inches have fallen this year.
The dead and drying brush forms a highly volatile fuel source.
Residents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, and firewood at least 30 feet from any building.

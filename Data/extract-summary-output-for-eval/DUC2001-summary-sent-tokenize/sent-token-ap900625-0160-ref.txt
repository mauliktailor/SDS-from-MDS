Abstract:Slovenian president Milan Kucan endorsed a plan for a constitution giving Slovenia full sovereignty and international-legal rights within a new Yugoslav confederation.
Slovenia's parliament almost certainly will approve the plan.
Serbian politicians have frequently accused Slovenia of harboring separatist tendencies and protecting its own interests at the expense of federal goals.
Slovenia says Serbia is trying to politically and economically dominate the Yugoslav federation by introducing greater federal control.
In a poll last March, 70% of Slovenia's 2 million inhabitants thought the region would be better off outside the Yugoslav federation.
Slovenia and Croatia both held free elections this year.

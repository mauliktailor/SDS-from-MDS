Abstract:Albert Hunt reports that pollsters have found the public losing confidence in the electoral system and the Congress.
People want more representation and this is the impetus behind the momentum for limiting terms of lawmakers.
Hunt believes these limits would result in more power going to the unelected staff and lobbyists.
Voters should never be prevented from electing who they think is best.
Other solutions might be eliminating some of Congress' perquisites and a fundamental overhaul of the committee system.
Legislators now are put on a committee and stay there, becoming stale and locked into outdated approaches.
The length of committee assignments should be limited.

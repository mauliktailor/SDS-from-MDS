Abstract:Last year's Armenian earthquake, with 25,000 killed, (13,000 injured and half a million homeless) brought the earth's yearly death total to its highest since 1976, when 10 times many died in a Chinese earthquake.
2,000 more died in other quakes last year.
The geological survey reported 61 significant quakes last year, including sites on the Nepal-Burma border, the Nepal-India border and the Burma-China border.
The United States recorded three significant quakes, in the Gulf of Alaska, Whittier and Pasadena, California.
Canada had one; Europe, Africa and Japan also recorded relatively minor quakes.

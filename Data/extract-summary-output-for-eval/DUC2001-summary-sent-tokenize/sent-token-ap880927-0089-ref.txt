Abstract:Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson left the Seoul Olympics stripped of his Gold Medal after positive drug tests.
Neither a spiked drink nor a switched sample as suggested by his coach could have accounted for the levels of steroids found in his tests.
Johnson has been suspended from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's national team for life.
Prime Minister Mulroney called this a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.
US sprinter Carl Lewis hoped that Johnson would straighten out his life and return to competition.
Lewis had said after the event that he couldn't understand how Johnson ran so fast after looking tired in qualifying heats.

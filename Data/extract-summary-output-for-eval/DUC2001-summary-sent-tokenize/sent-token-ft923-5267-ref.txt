Abstract:It is estimated that 275,000 people are without electricity and at least 150,000 are either homeless or living among ruins as a result of Hurricane Andrew which ripped through southern Florida last week.
President Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region since the hurricane hit.
He pledged the government would see through the clean-up "until the job is done".
US insurers expect to pay out $7.3 billion in Florida making Hurricane Andrew by far the costliest disaster the industry has ever faced.
This estimate does not include any projection for claims in Louisiana, so the final cost will be higher still.

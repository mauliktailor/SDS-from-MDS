Abstract:Virginia Thomas, wife of the nominee to the Supreme Court, has come under scrutiny and is the target of some criticism.
Critics see her as a woman with strong opinions on issues likely to come before the court.
She has represented the conservative views in her work on the staff of a Republican Congressman.
She and the nominee have said that women and blacks are hindered, rather than helped, by affirmative action.
Virginia Thomas is a white woman, and some prominent blacks outside government view this as Thomas' rejection of the black community.

Abstract:US cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on alert last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after hitting southern Florida leaving at least eight dead, causing severe property damage, and leaving 1.2 million homes without electricity.
Gusts of up to 165 mph were recorded.
It is the fiercest hurricane to hit the US in decades.
As Andrew moved across the Gulf there was concern that it might hit New Orleans, which would be particularly susceptible to flooding, or smash into the concentrated offshore oil facilities.
President Bush authorized federal disaster assistance for the affected areas.

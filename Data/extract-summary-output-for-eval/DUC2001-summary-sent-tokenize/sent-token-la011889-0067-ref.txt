Abstract:The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and FBI are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach policeman, Dickey, appeared to shove a black man's (Jackson's) face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop.
Although Dickey's attorney admitted that the officer was wrong to spice his orders to Jackson with obscenities, Jackson was booked for suspicion of using offensive language as well as challenging an officer to fight and obstructing arrest.
The assistant district attorney said that their office has taken on four to six charges of police brutality a year.

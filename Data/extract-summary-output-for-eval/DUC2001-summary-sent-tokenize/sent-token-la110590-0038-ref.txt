Abstract:The New York City Marathon winners for 1990 were Douglas Wakiihuri and Wanda Panfil.
For each, it was the third successful marathon victory and continues the domination of foreign runners in this marathon.
Wakiihuri is a Kenyan who trains in Japan.
He bolted away from a pack of runners at 20 miles and was clocked at 2:12:39 at the finish.
This timing was the slowest in six years.
Panfil's time was 2:30:45, the slowest winning women's time since 1978.
The last American winner for the men was Alberto Salazar in 1982.
The last woman winner was Miki Gorman in 1977.

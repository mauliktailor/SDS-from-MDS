Abstract:The town of Pinpoint
, Georgia celebrated Clarence Thomas' elevation to the Supreme Court.
When yesterday's climactic votes ensured that Thomas had survived the Senate ordeal, his mother, Leona Williams, literally jumped for joy.
She immediately called her son to give him her love.
A handwritten sign that had already been erected proclaimed that Pinpoint, Georgia was the home of Judge Clarence Thomas.
The community gathered in front of the town's only big screen television, and applauded and sang when the victory of the native son was certain.

Abstract:The Bank of Boston has begun a new policy in banking circles.
It has written-off as uncollectible loans to Third World countries.
The Bank of Boston, a regional bank, has an advantage over money- centered banks like those in New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Bank of Boston has a large loan-loss reserve that the large banks lack.
The inhibiting factor for regional banks is once you have been burned by the need to write-off a loan, you are much less likely to join any new such effort.
Other regional banks may follow Bank of Boston's lead.

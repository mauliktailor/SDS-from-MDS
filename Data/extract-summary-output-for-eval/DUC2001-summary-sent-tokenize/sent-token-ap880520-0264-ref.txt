Abstract:On March 25 federal military commanders planned to arrest nonconformist journalists, writers and officials in Slovenia, the most liberal of Yugoslavia's six republics, without notifying Slovenia's civilian leadership.
Military units would then crush demonstrations protesting the arrests.
The military council claims dissident tendencies and articles in the news media are part of a foreign backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's communist government.
The Slovenian Communist Party presidium, which frequently criticizes the way the federal government deals with the country's economic and social problems, and Slovenian police disagree with the conspiracy claim.
The plan was blocked after being reported by Slovenian security organizations.

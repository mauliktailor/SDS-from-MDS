Abstract:March 7, 1989, Dateline: Pasadena, California.
A partial solar eclipse was visible today across much of western North America.
Dozens of people watched it through two types of solar telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
Scientists warn against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters.
During this event the greatest blockage of the sun, 80%, occurred in Anchorage, Alaska.
For any single spot on earth, a partial eclipse occurs every several years.
Total solar eclipses at any single location occur roughly every four centuries, though they are visible from somewhere on earth about every two years.

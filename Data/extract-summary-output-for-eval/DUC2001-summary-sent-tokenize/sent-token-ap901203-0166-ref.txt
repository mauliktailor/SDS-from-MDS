Abstract:Climatologist Ira
Browning said there was a 50-50 chance of a major earthquake today along the New Madrid Fault, which stretches from Arkansas northeast through New Madrid, Missouri and into Cairo, Illinois.
No tremors were reported.
Some residents took precautions, however: some schools closed, some residents left town and some purchased earthquake emergency kits.
The U.S. Geological Survey, which received many calls from area residents, did not back the prediction.
Waverly Person of the Survey says, "Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible.
Mr. Browning's prediction was based on a study of tidal forces.

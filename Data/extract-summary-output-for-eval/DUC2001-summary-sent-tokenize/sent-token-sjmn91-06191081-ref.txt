Abstract:The commission that was appointed by Mayor Bradley and Police Chief Gates to investigate the Rodney King beating by Los Angeles police was to release its report today.
According to an anonymous source the report neither blames nor clears Chief Gates.
Gates has said he would resign if the commission agreed with critics that he created a climate within the police department that condoned racism and brutality.
The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups called for Gates to resign after the March 3 incident in which white police officers repeatedly struck King with batons, kicked him and shocked him with a stun gun.

Abstract:General Accident (GA), the leading British insurer, said yesterday that Hurricane Andrew could cost it as much as $40 million.
A company spokesman later explained, however, that GA has only a 1/2% share of the Florida market.
The company's adjusters who are trying to estimate the losses guess that losses by all insurers combined may total more that $8 billion, but there have been other estimates that the storm caused more than $20 billion of damage.
Still other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low as $1 billion. "
No one knows at this time what the exact loss is".
the spokesman explained.

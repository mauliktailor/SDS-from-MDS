Abstract:Construction of a 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it underwater, is underway between Dover, England to the coast of France.
Scheduled to be completed in 1993, it will cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three.
It will enable freight to travel on a single train instead of being transferred to trucks for a ferry trip.
Some wonder whether Britain will be ready for it.
A writer on the project said, "They're still arguing about whether it will introduce rabies into this country, or let in terrorists".
Critics say obsolete commuter lines in SE England will cause delays.

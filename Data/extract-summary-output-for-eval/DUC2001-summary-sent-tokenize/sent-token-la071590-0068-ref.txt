Abstract:Over the past two years the Ventura district attorney's office in four separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they were victims of police brutality while being arrested by Oxnard officers.
In a fifth case an Oxnard man who says he and others at a private party were beaten by Oxnard police, was prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest rather than assaulting an officer as charged by the arresting officer.
The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits.
In every case it is alleged that officers beat or severely manhandled the victim without provocation.

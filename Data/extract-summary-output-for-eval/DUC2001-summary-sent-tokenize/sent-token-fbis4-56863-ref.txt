Abstract:The Shining Path Central Committee, comprised of leaders who have not been arrested, held a meeting in February presided over by "Feliciano".
Reportedly they decided to continue the "people's war" and reject members advocating the peace accord.
A five-point document reasserted the violence rising from a 1992 agreement, emphasized a 1993 position supporting political and military continuation of the people's war including in cities, and condemned members seeking peace as "the Black Group".
The leaders claim a man in prison (Guzman) cannot lead a communist organization, but hope to retain Guzman's ideological principles and popular support to resume fighting.

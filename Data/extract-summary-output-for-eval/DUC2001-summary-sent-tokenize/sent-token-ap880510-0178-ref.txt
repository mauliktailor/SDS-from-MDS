Abstract:
The United States has denied an accusation by Yasser Arafat that the United States is threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinian guerrillas attack American targets.
The State Department said it has received reports that the PLO might target Americans because of alleged US involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir.
The PLO's second in command, in a raid on his house near Tunis on 16 April.
Israeli officials said that an Israeli squad carried out the assassination.
Apparently, Arafat's claims stem from his interpretation of US correspondence with Middle East countries about possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.

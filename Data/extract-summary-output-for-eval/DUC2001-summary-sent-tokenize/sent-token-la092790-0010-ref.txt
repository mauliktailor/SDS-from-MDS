Abstract:Nelson Polsby
does not believe term limits will give their proponents what they want.
Term limitation will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money because new candidates need even more money to get recognition.
Inexperienced legislators must learn their job from the legislative staff, bureaucrats and lobbyists, thus shifting the power from the elected officials.
We should vote poor performers out.
Terms limits would only throw the good out with the bad.
He also fears the main supporters of term limits are those who are assuming non-incumbents are easier to beat or buy.

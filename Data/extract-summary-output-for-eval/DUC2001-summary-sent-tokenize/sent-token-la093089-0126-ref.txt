Abstract:Illegal aliens will not be counted in the 1990 Census if the Senate vote stands.
States with large immigration populations may be adversely affected.
Now a Senate-House conference committee will decide whether to attach the illegal immigrants ban to a 17.4 billion appropriations bill for the State, Commerce and Justice Departments.
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher will request that President Bush veto any bill that includes the provisions against counting the illegal immigrants.
The states of California, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and others stand to loose congressional seats based on this Census count.

Abstract:Two new studies show the men and women who battle wildfires face an unseen hazard -- the effects from poisonous gasses and soot in wildfire smoke.
Among the culprits are carbon monoxide (impairs judgement), microscopic carbon particles (lodges in the lungs), aldehydes (irritates air passages), and hydrocarbon-based substances (gene damage and cancer).
Wildfire smoke also may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks, and trigger respiratory diseases (bronchitis or asthma).
Overly heavy gear and inadequate filters are major problems.
Developing protection has received little attention.
Researchers have asked Congress to fund a $13.4 million study on health threat and respiratory protection.

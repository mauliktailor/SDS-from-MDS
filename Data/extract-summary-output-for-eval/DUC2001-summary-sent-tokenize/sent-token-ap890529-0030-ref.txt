Abstract:At the opening of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters hope for new technological help critical to growing coastal populations.
The Air Force is phasing out hurricane reconnaissance flights, agreeing to only two more years.
Only one satellite is now available for tracking hurricanes.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been approached to take over the flights.
New satellites are not expected until late 1990.
Forecaster Hal Gerrish said that "now we can see past the Antilles into the Atlantic and over toward Hawaii on the west," but he would like to be able to see all the way to Africa where Atlantic hurricanes develop.

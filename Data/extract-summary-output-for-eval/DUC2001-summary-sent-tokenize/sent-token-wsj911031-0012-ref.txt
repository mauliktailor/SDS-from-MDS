Abstract:William Mellor discusses the constitutionality of term limits.
While laws baring first-time candidates from running have been invalidated, state laws limiting tenure of congressional officeholders have not been tested.
Florida will provide an opinion later in the month.
California's limit on state terms has been upheld.
Term limits do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his ideology and candidates may be elected to a different office or re-elected to the same office after a waiting period.
Term limits also do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that the states have the power to regulate elections.

Abstract:Ben Johnson's physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, said that Johnson took banned steroid, stanzolol, once, four months before the Seoul Olympics.
It caused him violent muscle spasms.
Astaphan said that Johnson was not on the drug when he beat Carl Lewis in a world record time of 9.79 seconds for 100 meters.
When asked how he could be certain, Astaphan said that he did not have a constant check on Johnson but doubted that he would return to a drug that caused him a problem earlier.
Commission counsel said it was irresponsible to make such statements outside the commission.

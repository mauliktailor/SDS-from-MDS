Abstract:One in eight Latino adults in the LA area have diabetes, a higher incidence than in any other ethnic group except American Indians.
Nationwide estimates are that more than two million Latinos are diabetic.
An educational effort is underway in California.
Adult onset diabetes is preventable by diet and exercise, and obesity is a predisposing factor.
It is believed that Latino immigrants frequently eat a fast or fatty food diet and exercise less, causing obesity and, frequently, diabetes, according to the Diabetes Association, which is sponsoring education programs including information on prevention, symptoms and complications of the disease.

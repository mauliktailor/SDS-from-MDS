Abstract:
National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets answered reporters' questions as he dealt with his first hurricane since becoming director.
Gilbert, a highly destructive hurricane was moving across the western Caribbean.
Sheets said that Gilbert would be considered a "Great Hurricane", in the top 10% as far as intensity, size, and destructive potential.
Gilbert was being compared to the 1935 hurricane which killed 600 people and Hurricane Camille which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256.
The last major hurricane to make landfall was Elena in 1985.
Sheets said that Gilbert is "well-behaved" doing what "we think it's going to do".

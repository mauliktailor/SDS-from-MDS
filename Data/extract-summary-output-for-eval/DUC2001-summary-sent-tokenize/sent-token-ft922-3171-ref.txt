Abstract:Weeks ago a North American free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico seemed assured, with support of Republicans and most congressional Democrats.
Now strong opposition comes from presidential candidate Ross Perot and working class Hispanic Americans who say NAFTA will cost jobs.
White House polls show President Bush's support for NAFTA is a winning issue.
Trade lobbyists think Democrats will use it as a weapon, citing his 1991 commitment to environmental issues and labor.
Democratic frontrunner Clinton will likely deem NAFTA the wrong kind of agreement.
The environment, farm and labor coalition will not support NAFTA without environment or food safety provisions.

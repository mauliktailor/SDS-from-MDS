Abstract:On Friday, The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to press charges against several physicians after looking into allegations that they over-prescribed painkillers to actress Elizabeth Taylor.
In a written report, the district attorney's office said the prescribing practices "fell below the accepted standard of medical practice," but added the doctors "were also attempting to deal with her addiction through alternative means of therapy and treatment, and "devoid of criminal intent".
The report went on to say that one of the physicians repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Taylor to enter a rehabilitation clinic but she rejected these efforts until October 1988.

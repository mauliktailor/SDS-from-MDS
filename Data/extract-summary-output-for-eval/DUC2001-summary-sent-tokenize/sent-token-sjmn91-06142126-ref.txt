Abstract:Because of a five-year drought and rains that nurtured grass now turning dry
, California is gearing up for a dangerous wildfire season.
Firefighters are most concerned about certain rural areas.
Residents have been advised to take special precautions; notably, clearing a 30-foot defensible space of dry grass and brush around the house; removing all pine needles and leaves from roofs, eaves and gutters; trimming tree limbs within 10 feet of the chimney and all limbs hanging over the house or garage; treating wood shingle roofs with fire retardant; making sure of adequate access for firefighters; ensuring that neighborhood streets are clearly identified.

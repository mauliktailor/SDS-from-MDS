Twenty passengers and a crew of five died as the plane nosedived to earth while traveling from Denver to Colorado Springs.

In July, 1988 a United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa with 110 fatalities, after an engine broke apart in flight.
In February, 1989, the cargo door on a United Boeing 747 opened in flight, ripping a hole in the fuselage.
Nine people were killed.

Abstract:Multitudes of native peoples, tourists and scientists today observed a sun that was blackened for up to four minutes.
The total eclipse along a 108-mile swath moved from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the southern Philippine island of Mindanao and ended in the Gulf of Alaska.
A partial eclipse was visible as far west as India.
Despite scattered clouds in much of the eclipse area, scientists were confident they had taken useful pictures.
Native peoples celebrated the event with cheering, dancing, drums, festivals and indigenous rituals.
The Chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse in 2137 B.C.

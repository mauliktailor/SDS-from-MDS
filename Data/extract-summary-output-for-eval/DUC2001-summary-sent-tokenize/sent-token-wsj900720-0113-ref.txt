Abstract:
The strength and success of the Shining Path guerrillas remain a question as Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru's president on July 28.
The guerrillas began fighting cautiously in 1980, but became lethal quickly.
The governments claims 20,000 have died and damages of $16 billion.
Now 50% of the Peruvians live under emergency law.
President Belaunde ignored the guerrillas, while President Garcia, after first trying a liberal approach, became tough, then eventually tried simply to coexist.
While Fujimori's campaign pitch advocated economic-development initiatives, his actual policies may be quite different.
The government claims to have captured a "safe house" in Lima on June 4.

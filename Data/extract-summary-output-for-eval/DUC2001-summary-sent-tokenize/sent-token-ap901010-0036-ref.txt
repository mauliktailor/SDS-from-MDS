Abstract:A United States Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed at dawn today in Saudi Arabia.
Both crew members were killed.
The aircraft was assigned to the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at Lakenheath in Britain, and was deployed to Saudi Arabia via Turkey as Operation Desert Shield progressed.
The F-111 crash followed closely upon Monday's disappearance of two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters over the Arabian Sea, and the crash of an Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet on the same day.
Today's crash raises the number of Americans killed in Saudi Arabia to at least nine.

Abstract:Some 40 members of Congress have joined with the Federation for American Immigration Reform in announcing that a suit will be filed in an effort to stop the Census Bureau from counting the estimated 2 million illegal aliens living in the United States.
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said everyone should be counted but the Census Bureau should develop a method to determine how many people are illegal and deduct that number from the figures used for reapportioning Congress.

Rep. Jan Meyers, R-Kan., suggested that a question should be put on the Census form asking whether respondents are U.S. citizens.

Abstract:Health Professionals and the Diabetes Society in California are presenting a program to educate Hispanics in healthy food preparation and diabetes prevention.
Food preparation, specifically frying of foods in saturated fats, are believed to be one cause of the obesity problem that often leads to diabetes.
Other factors stressed are nutrition, spacing of food intake throughout the day, and exercise.
This is the first time education has centered on prevention of the disease.
Educators in California and other heavily Hispanic areas are learning that cultural factors are highly important in combating the alarming rise of diabetes among this population.

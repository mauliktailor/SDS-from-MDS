Abstract:Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, caused an oil drilling work vessel to capsize, trapping as many as 10 crew members.
Rescue divers were unable to search the overturned vessel because of strong winds and high waves.
The search had to be called off
but it was hoped that some of the crew were in airtight cabins with enough oxygen to survive.
Chantal was expected to hit the western Louisiana or upper Texas coast.
Coastal residents prepared for the storm and grocery stores reported a steady demand for hurricane staples: bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows.

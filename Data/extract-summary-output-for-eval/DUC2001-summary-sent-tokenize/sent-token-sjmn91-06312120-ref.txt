Abstract:Marathon vacations?
Isn't that a contradiction in terms?
Not so, says the owner of a company that arranges tours for people who want to take a vacation and run a 26.2-mile marathon at the same time.
The tours are arranged to some of the more famous marathon cities, e.g., Boston, London, and Berlin.
Entry fees, medical examinations, and other requirements are all included in the tour package.
Runners are guaranteed places in marathons.
Running in a marathon vacation may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is a unique way to see a city.

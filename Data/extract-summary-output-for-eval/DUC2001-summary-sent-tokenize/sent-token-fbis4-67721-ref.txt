Abstract:The number of cases of tuberculosis reported in Latvia during 1993 was 868, compared to 771 in 1992.
The number of deaths increased at an even greater rate of 41 percent.
The State Tuberculosis and Lung Center said that poor socioeconomic conditions could account for the increase.
Latvia does not have a law that would require mandatory treatment for infectious cases of tuberculosis.
The Department of Health submitted a proposal for such a law but no action has been taken.
There are 11 state tuberculosis hospitals in Latvia that provide free care for those with active cases.

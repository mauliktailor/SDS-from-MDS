Abstract:Lawmakers are having difficulty coming to an agreement on whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the 1990 census.
The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to count all the "persons" in the country every ten years for purposes of reapportionment of seats in the house of representatives.
It does not specify citizens.
Some representatives feel that illegal aliens, if counted, may give some states like California and Texas and extra seat.
Since there is a 435-seat limit, some representatives fear that their states may loose a seat.
In the past, every state has counted legal and illegal aliens in the census.

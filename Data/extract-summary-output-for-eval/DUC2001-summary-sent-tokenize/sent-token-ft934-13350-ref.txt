Abstract:As the November 17 House vote on NAFTA approaches, the White House is summoning undecided congressmen, business leaders and journalists for intimate briefings in order to sway their votes.
To win the votes of 8 Hispanic congressmen, Clinton will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank to fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from NAFTA.
Cabinet members are traveling to congressional districts to publicize factories expected to gain jobs under NAFTA.
Clinton spoke at an exhibit of products likely to benefit, while the AFL-CIO presented speakers who lost their jobs when their employers moved to Mexico.

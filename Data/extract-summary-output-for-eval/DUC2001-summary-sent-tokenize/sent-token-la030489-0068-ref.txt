Abstract:A white Long Beach police officer, Mark Dickey, who allegedly pushed a black man, Don Jackson, through a plate-glass window during an arrest has acknowledged to a Senate oversight committee that he made errors in his official report.
Dickey admitted that it was he and not Jackson who uttered obscenities during the arrest.
Jackson testified that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, Dickey hurt him by bending his fingers while handcuffing him and pushing his face into the hood of the police car.
Officers refused to loosen his handcuffs as he was taken to the station, Jackson said.

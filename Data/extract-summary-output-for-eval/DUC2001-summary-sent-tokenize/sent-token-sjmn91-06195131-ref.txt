Abstract:Anti-abortion demonstrators charge that police in more than 50 cities have used excessive force against them.
Retired Roman Catholic Bishop George Lynch of New York vividly described the pain suffered when he was apprehended by West Hartford, Conn. police in 1989.
The demonstrators claim that police tactics in Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual abuse against women who have been arrested.
While the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police has led to widespread calls for investigation of police brutality, little attention has been directed to police brutality and abuse suffered by the anti-abortion demonstrators.

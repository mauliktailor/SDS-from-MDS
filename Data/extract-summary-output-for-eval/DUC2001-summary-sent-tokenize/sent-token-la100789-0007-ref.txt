Abstract:
The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed".
The Second Amendment was originated by some of the states as protection against the federal government.
The word "people" is used collectively and refers to a political entity such as a state.
The Supreme Court on several occasions in the past has ruled that this amendment did not create a federally- protected right of individuals to bear arms but rather, limited the power of the federal government.

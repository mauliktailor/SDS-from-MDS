Abstract:
Lieutenant Zanti intends to match the efforts of his wife and father who are running in the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington.
The naval officer is planning on running on the battleship WISCONSIN.
Zanti had been stationed in the Mediterranean and planned on training on land and on the ship.
Because of the ship's deployment to the Persian Gulf, these plans were canceled.
The WISCONSIN is 887 feet long or about 1/6 of a mile.
Zanti will have to do about 75 laps to equal 26.2 miles.
Zanti became interested in marathon running while watching his father in California marathons.

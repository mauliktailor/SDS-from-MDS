Abstract:A panel was assembled last September after the worst fire season ever in drought-primed Yellowstone National Park to examine the government's "let it burn" forest fire policy.
The panel suggested a temporary halt to the "let it burn" policy saying the Forest Service and the National Park Service needed more time to refine their fire management plans.
The study came after some 249 fires seared 706,278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percent as much again in nearby national forests.
The review team was asked to look at policies throughout the national parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone.

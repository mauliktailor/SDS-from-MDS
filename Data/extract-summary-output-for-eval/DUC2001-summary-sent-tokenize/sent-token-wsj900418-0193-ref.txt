Abstract:
According to a recent Gallup poll, 70% of the members of the House of Representatives oppose limiting the number of congressional terms, while almost two- thirds of the public support the idea.
Franking privileges and campaign finance laws make defeating an incumbent very difficult, with 96% of incumbents re-elected over the past three elections.
Also, one in four incumbents this year will have no major party opposition.
This trend is spreading to the Senate.
Since presidents are limited to two terms, political power has shifted to the legislature.
Congressional careerism has become the norm, and some want a constitutional amendment to limit terms.

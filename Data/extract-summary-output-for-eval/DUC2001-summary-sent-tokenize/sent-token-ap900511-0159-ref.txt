Abstract:Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized for viral pneumonia, suffered complications including bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection and will be hospitalized for about six more weeks, doctors said on Friday.
Miss Taylor is being treated with antibiotics that are effective against bacteria but not viruses.
"She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors are pleased with her progress," Miss Taylor's publicist, Chem Sam, said after talking to doctors.
Earlier this week, Ms. Sam said the 58-year-old actress was improving and would be released from the hospital this week.
Last month, Miss Taylor's doctors revealed she was near death on April 22.

Abstract:Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knocked off track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids now says that it's wrong to cheat and bad for health.
Johnson said, "I got caught in Seoul.
I lost my gold medal".
Some US Congressional Representatives are presenting legislation to make anabolic steroids a controlled substance similar to the designation given to cocaine and heroin.
The legislators emphasized increasing abuse of steroids by athletes at all levels.
Johnson told other athletes not to make the mistake that he did urging them "to come forward, to come clean".

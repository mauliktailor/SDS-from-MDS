Abstract:The Exxon Valdez was illegally piloted by its third mate, who didn't have a proper pilot's license, when the vessel ran aground.
Exxon said the captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was not on the bridge at the time of the the accident, contrary to company policy.
The captain and two crew members were relieved of duty and subpoenaed by the NSTB.
Two supertankers remained anchored offshore by the closure of the Valdez port.
Alaska's governor declared the pristine Prince William Sound a disaster area.
The Coast Guard estimated the spill as covering 100 square miles.
Many fishermen expected minimal harvests and long term damage to its reputation.

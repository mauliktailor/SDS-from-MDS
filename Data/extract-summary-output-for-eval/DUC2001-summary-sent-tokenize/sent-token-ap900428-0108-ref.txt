Abstract:Less than a month before the 1990 elections, a third presidential candidate in Colombia, Carlos Pizarro, was assassinated in a jetliner taking off from Bogota by a gunman on a suicide mission.
Pizarro's bodyguards killed the assassin.
The assassination of the other two candidates was blamed on drug traffickers.
The media, citing security sources, reported that traffickers were the main suspects in Pizarro's killing as well.
The Medallion cartel denied involvement.
Traffickers have killed nearly 300 Colombians in the past nine months in an effort to halt the government's campaign to capture and expedite drug barons to the United States.

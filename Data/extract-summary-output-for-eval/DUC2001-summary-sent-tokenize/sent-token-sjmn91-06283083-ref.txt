Abstract:The Christopher Commission's scathing report on the Los Angeles Police Department found racism, brutality, inadequate discipline, mismanagement and a "siege mentality" pitting officers against the community.
Now critics are calling for the same kind of independent investigation of the sheriff's department after sheriff's deputies shot four people dead in the space of one month, three deputies were charged with stealing credit cards from elderly people, and there have been renewed charges that the department is home to white supremacist gangs.
The FBI, Amnesty International and the county grand jury are investigation allegations about both the police and sheriff's departments.

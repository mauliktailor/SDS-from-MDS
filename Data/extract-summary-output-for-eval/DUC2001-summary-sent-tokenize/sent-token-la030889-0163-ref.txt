Abstract:Canadian coach Charlie Francis who claimed that Ben Johnson's urine sample at the Olympics was spiked with a banned substance worried that Johnson might test positive.
Lynda Huey a physical therapist at the Olympics said that Francis told her that Johnson was more afraid of failing the drug test than he was of Carl Lewis.
Francis said that Johnson was not taking the steroid stanozolol before the games and was clean at the Olympics but Huey said that Francis must have had some reason to think that Johnson might not pass the test.

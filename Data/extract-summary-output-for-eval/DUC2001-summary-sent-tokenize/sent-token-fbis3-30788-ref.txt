Abstract:Slovenia sent a delegation to Belgrade to discuss normalization of relations with Yugoslavia, including exchanging diplomatic representatives and abolishing visa requirements for Yugoslav citizens, but agreement probably won't come soon.
The softening of the Slovene attitude is an effort to adapt Slovene policy to that of the European Union, which Slovenia wants to join.
Yugoslavia is distrustful and resents Slovenia's attitude toward Kosovo and support of arms for Bosnia.
It expresses interest in normal relations but says before they can take place, Slovenia must apologize for its rebuff of Yugoslavia's offer to recognize Slovenia a year ago, and must end its anti- Serbian campaign.

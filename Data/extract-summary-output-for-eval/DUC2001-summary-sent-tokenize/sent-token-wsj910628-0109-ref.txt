Abstract:Two days after Slovenia and Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia, the federal government mobilized troops to regain control, beginning with Austrian border crossings.
The Slovenian militia, formed in the past several months, is outmatched by the army's 180,000 troops, armored vehicles and air force.
Fighting across Slovenia resulted in 100 dead and wounded.
The West has lobbied for maintenance of the Yugoslav state, threatening to withhold aid if the country breaks up.
Serbia fears losing the economic support of Slovenia and Croatia, who supply most of Yugoslavia's wealth and have tired of the erosion of their finances by the Serbian-dominated bureaucracy.

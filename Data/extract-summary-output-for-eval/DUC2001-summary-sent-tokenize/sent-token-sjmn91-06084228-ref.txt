Abstract:Canadian sprint coach Charlie Francis testifying in 1988 in a Toronto inquiry about use of performance-enhancing drugs made it plain that he had given his athletes every steroid combination imaginable.
His star pupil, Ben Johnson, ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds in the Seoul Olympics but lost his Gold Medal when he tested positive for drug use.
Francis said that steroid use permits an athlete to train harder but not run faster.
Francis says steroid use is rampant.
After a two year ban, Johnson is running again without Francis' coaching.
Francis believes that without steroids, Johnson cannot be the fastest, although still fast.

Abstract:Scientists have found a hormone that may lead to new treatments for Type II diabetes.
News of the hormone, Amylin, was reported by Dr. Garth Cooper of New Zealand to the International Diabetes Federation.
Researchers believe that amylin, found in high levels in the diabetic pancreas, appears to be responsible for the obesity and lower insulin secretion and effectiveness found in Type II diabetics.
Obesity is currently thought of as a cause, not an effect of, diabetes.
Insulin normally controls blood sugar; in type II diabetes it becomes ineffective and blood sugar rises.
Complications include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene of the extremities.
Researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin's action.

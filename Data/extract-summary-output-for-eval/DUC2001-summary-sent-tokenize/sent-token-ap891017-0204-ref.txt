Abstract:
The earthquake in the Bay area on Tuesday had been targeted as likely to have one by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1998.
The prediction was based on time elapse since the 1906 San Francisco quake, among other factors.
The quake registered 6.9 on the Richter scale and was centered in the Santa Cruz, California, area.
Reports indicated widespread damage, especially on highways and old masonry buildings.
A quake of 7 on the Richter scale can cause major heavy damage.
Some Southern California areas have an even higher probability of a major quake, the highest being Bakersfield in central California with a 90% probability.

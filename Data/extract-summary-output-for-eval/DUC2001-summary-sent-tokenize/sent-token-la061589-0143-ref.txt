Abstract:
US track and field officials said that Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100 meter dash.
Johnson testified at a Canadian inquiry that he had been involved with illegal performance-enhancing drugs for seven years and had injections before he set the world record in the 1987 World Championship in Rome.
His coach and physician had also testified at the inquiry.
Carl Lewis said that while Johnson had not told the truth earlier, he was doing so now and speaking out against drugs and should be allowed back in the sport after he finishes his suspension.

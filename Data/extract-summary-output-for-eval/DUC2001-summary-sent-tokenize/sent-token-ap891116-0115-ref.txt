Abstract:
In Huntsville, Alabama, a tornado, without warning, carved a three-mile stretch of destruction, killing 17 people, injuring 463 and leaving 1,000 homeless.
It hopped along a 25-mile path plowing through a school, rural areas, a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.
It tossed cars and trucks on Interstate 85.
It was one of a series that touched down in seven states from the Deep South to the Midwest.
Later, a tornado watch was issued for the Atlantic coast and New England states.
This was Alabama's deadliest twister since 1975 when 22 people died in Birmingham.
Officials are requesting federal disaster assistance.

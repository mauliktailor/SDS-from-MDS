Abstract:Clinton campaigned on welfare reform.
But, as president, he is first addressing two higher priorities: deficit reduction and healthcare reform, both of which, he believes, will help alleviate welfare.
He has improved the earned income tax credit and will enforce laws requiring financial support from absentee fathers.
These measures may help but will not solve America's welfare problems.
Many conservatives favor a strict time limit, two years, for welfare.
Most people consider this too drastic.
Something like an FDR public sector works program, although probably not affordable, might work.
Many think the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988 is the answer.

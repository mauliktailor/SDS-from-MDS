Abstract:The World Health Organization, after the first global study of tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease is now the worlds deadliest infectious disease.
The disease kills nearly three million a year, most between the ages of 15 and 59.
It is anticipated that the number of deaths will rise sharply, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia.
The increases already seen and those anticipated are attributed in large measure to the connection between AIDS and tuberculosis.
At one time experts thought that tuberculosis was on a path to extinction, and its now epidemic proportion is disheartening.

Abstract:Meteorologist William Gray predicts more intense Atlantic hurricanes in the coming decade or two unlike the 1970s and 1980s because of an apparent break in the African drought.
Rainfall in the Sahel, typically associated with more intense hurricanes was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969.
Hurricane Hugo had sustained winds of 150 mph and an atmospheric pressure of 27.1 inches.
Officially a four, Hugo may have been a borderline 5.
The threat of global warming may also portend hurricanes more powerful says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of MIT.
To develop, Hurricanes need ocean surface temperatures of above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

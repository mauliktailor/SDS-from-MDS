Abstract:
De Beers' 100-year old Kimberley diamond mines are running out but it is maintaining output and market stability in the face of Russian export uncertainty by expanding other mines.
Millions are being put into the Jwaneng mine in Botswana to continue open pit digging for 35 years, after which mining may go underground.
Jwaneng, the richest diamond mine in the world, is co-owned by Botswana and De Beers and is the major Botswana revenue source.
At the De Beers-owned Finsch mine in South Africa, digging has gone underground to give the mine another 35-40 years of life, with remote- controlled trucks digging out material in dangerous areas.

Abstract:
The Agriculture Department reports that it has been on top of the drought since March 1, when a drought task force was established.
A "USDA Backgrounder" was released listing actions.
The only two which involved money were an extra $50 million to buy beef for feeding programs and allowing Mexico to buy $40 million worth of meat.
Actions have included allowing use for grazing and hay cutting of acreage in conservation programs, Congressional briefings, interagency meetings, news conferences, daily weather updates, a toll-free hotline on federal services available, and crop surveys.

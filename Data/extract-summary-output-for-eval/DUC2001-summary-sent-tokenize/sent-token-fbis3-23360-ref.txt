Abstract:Lebanese security authorities, in coordination with Jordanian authorities, unraveled the mystery of the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut on 29 January 1994.
Apparently, the Abu-Nidal group is not the only party responsible for the operation.
An investigation revealed that the Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC) carried out the assassination in coordination with the Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic Mobilization Youth Organization (IMYO).
When IMYO was exposed, several terrorist groups moved to neighboring Arab countries; namely, Jordan and Iran.
The assassination was intended as revenge against the Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Jordan, which did not agree with the extremism of other fundamentalists.

Abstract:
Coast Guard Commandant Yost attacked Exxon's plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill.
Also, consumer activist Ralph Nader, other environmentalists, and politicians expressed anger in a one day "Boycott Exxon" campaign.
The cleanup is to be paid for by the oil industry and could add $100-500M to Alaska's economy, more than offsetting the loss to the fishing industry.
Thousands of dead birds were spotted 300 miles from the spill site.
Since the Exxon Valdez spill, gas prices have increased 10% nationally and as much as 25% in the Northwest.
Nebraska's two senators have asked the US Attorney General to investigate possible price gouging by the oil industry.

Abstract:Here are some tornado facts.
The portion of a thunderstorm adjacent to large hail is where tornadoes are most likely to occur.
They generally track southwest to northeast.
Less than two percent of all tornadoes are classified as violent, with wind speeds of more than 200mph and a path averaging twenty-six miles.
The longest tornado on record went 219 miles across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana in March 1925.
Tornadoes travel and average of 30mph, but can stand still or go 70mph.
The largest outbreak of twisters on record was in April 1974 when 148 storms killed 300 people in 13 states over two days.

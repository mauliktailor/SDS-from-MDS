Abstract:
According to Peru's President Garcia, Shining Path rebels have formed the People's Defense Revolutionary Movement to carry their operations into Lima and other coastal urban areas.
The Shining Path currently operates in at least half of Peru, especially in the mountains and jungle, drawing support from indigenous peoples who resent historic domination by ethnic Europeans.
The presidential run-off election between Mario Vargas Llosa and Alberto Fujimori is later this week.
Recent violence includes two car bombings near the Government Palace, a rebel takeover of a electoral office, destruction of high-tension power pylons, and attacks on a city bus and a stove factory.

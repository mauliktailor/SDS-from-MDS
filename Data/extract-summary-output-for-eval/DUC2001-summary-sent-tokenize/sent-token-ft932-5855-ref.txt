Abstract:The US Hispanic community is deeply divided on NAFTA.
Important US Hispanic coalitions like the civil rights group La Raza and the Southwest Voter Registration Project fear US Hispanics would bear most of NAFTA's negative impact.
Sectors of the US economy most vulnerable to import penetration are those most dependent on recent immigration for their labor.
The groups are making stringent side agreements protecting worker rights and the environment a condition of their support, demanding retraining of displaced workers and proposing a trilateral Development Bank to direct resources to negatively affected regions.
Hispanic business organizations enthusiastically back NAFTA and fear side agreements could jeopardize it.

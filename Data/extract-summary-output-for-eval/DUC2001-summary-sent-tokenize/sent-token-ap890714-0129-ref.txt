Abstract:Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets.
Officials said 566 Gila trout, placed on the endangered species list in 1967, were fished out of Diamond Creek and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.
Meanwhile in California, firefighters battled an arson fire that has charred more than 3,000 acres.
Firefighters and National Guardsmen contained one of the larger fires covering 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge in Nebraska on Wednesday.

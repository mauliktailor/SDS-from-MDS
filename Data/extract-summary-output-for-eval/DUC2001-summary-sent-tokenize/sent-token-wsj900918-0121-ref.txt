Abstract:The prediction of a major earthquake along the New Madrid Fault is causing a stir in Tennessee.
Some to plan to leave the area; there are plans to close schools and businesses in December and others are crowding into earthquake survival classes.
This is a result of a prediction by Iben Browning, a scientist who predicted the Bay Area and Mexico City quakes.
This area suffered a series of earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 estimated to be higher than an 8 on the then non-existent Richter scale.
The New Madrid fault is 120 miles long.

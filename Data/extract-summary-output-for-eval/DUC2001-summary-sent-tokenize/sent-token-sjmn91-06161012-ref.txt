Abstract:One of the longest total eclipses this century will pass from Hawaii through the southern Baja California peninsula into central Brazil.
The "Period of totality" will last the longest in the town of Tuxpan on Mexico's west coast.
Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots because they offer the best chance of cloudless skies.
50,000 to 70,000 sun watchers are expected at each place.
Accommodations and transportation to these places are totally booked.
Mexican authorities will turn back travelers in the Baja who do not have written proof of accommodations.
Airlines may also be very overbooked.
This could get ugly.

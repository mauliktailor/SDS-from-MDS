Abstract:A Chicago City Council committee held two days of hearings last week on allegations of police brutality against blacks.
Blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers--most of them white--of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
A 55-year-old grandmother testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her "the sign of the Ku Klux Klan".
Mayor Richard M. Daley declared, "I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago.
Everyone should join together...to help alleviate this problem".

Abstract:Workman tunneling under the English Channel Tuesday created the first land link between Britain and France when British workers sent a two-inch wide probe through to their French colleagues.
The tunnel symbolizes the growing unification of Europe.
Despite her countrymen's fears of losing their ancient moat against Europe, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, "This is what Europe is about".
The link-up was on time despite a pay strike by militant French workers and two serious injuries.
France hopes the project will revitalize depressed northern regions.
Many Britons fear an influx of Continental ills ranging from terrorists to rabid animals.

Abstract:Lewis Preston is about to take over the World Bank.
His problem is how to promote development and reduce the Third World debt.
Programs to date have not solved this problem.
The U.S. Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and invest directly in the private sector.
Other bank managers want to see political strings attached to the World Bank's loans.
The World Bank's goals of democracy and free markets are alien to some Third World countries.
The bank's own research department believes that poverty must be relieved directly and thence education and health care improved.

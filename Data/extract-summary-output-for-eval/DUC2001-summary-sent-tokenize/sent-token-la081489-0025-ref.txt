Abstract:All sixteen aboard a twin engine Otter were killed after it crashed into a mountain in Ethiopia.
The wreckage was found after a six day search in poor weather.
U.S. Army search helicopters had to lower men to the ground at the site, since there was no landing area on the mountainside, where the grade is 60%.
The plane was carrying Representative Mickey Leland of Texas to an Ethiopian refugee camp, one of several he was touring as Chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, which he helped to establish.
Other government officials were aboard.
The cause of the crash is under investigation.

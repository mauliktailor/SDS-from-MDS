Abstract:A United States Air Force C-5 transport crashed early Wednesday as it left Ramstein Air Base in Germany, a stopover point for the huge aircraft that was carrying medical supplies and equipment destined for American forces in Saudi Arabia.
The plane was assigned to the 60th Military Airlift Squadron in California.
Nine of the 13 killed were reservists who had volunteered to help in the military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
The C-5 is the largest transport in the inventory, and Wednesday's crash was the first C-5 to go down since one crashed in April 1975, killing 172 people.

Abstract:The Police Chief of San Jose, CA, argues that the brutal beating of Rodney King by four Los Angeles policemen would not have happened if the four had feared that any of the 17 other officers watching would report their criminal actions.
Other chiefs of police must forsake their own code of silence and condemn Police Chief Daryl Gates.
The people of Los Angeles believe that police brutality is common and disapprove of the way Mr. Gates has done his job.
The cloud Gates has cast over policing won't be lifted until police chiefs speak out against one of their own.

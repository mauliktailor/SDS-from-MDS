Abstract:A single engine Cessna P210 crashed into a ditch on the outskirts of Albuquerque, New Mexico in squally weather, killing four adults and a child.
The pilot had previously attempted a landing, but aborted the try.
He was circling the field to try again when the crash occurred.
There was no fire, but the plane cartwheeled and all aboard were killed.
An eye-witness, Walter Ramazinni, said that the plane had banked left when a gust of wind caught him.
He banked to the right, then left, and crashed.
The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate.

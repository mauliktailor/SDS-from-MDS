Abstract:
The Egyptian government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination in October 1990 of its second highest official, Rifaat el- Mahgoub.
He is the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat nine years ago.
Four assassins riding two motorbikes killed el-
Mahgoub in a car.
The death toll from the attack rose to six with the death of his chauffeur.
Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Mirissa had warned days earlier of such an attack.
He said authorities arrested alleged saboteurs who were entering the country with orders from Iraqi President Saddem Hussein to assassinate Egyptian officials.

Abstract:Madison, Florida, a town of 3500 people, is about fifty miles east of Tallahassee.
Before dawn, a tornado blasted through town, destroying several homes and a college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping cars and leaving four people dead and fifteen injured.
Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes that were blown apart.
It lasted under thirty minutes.
Two other tornadoes struck about 100 miles west of Madison.
All were spawned by a storm system that struck across the Southeast.
A belt of thunderstorms being pushed by a cold front caused hail and damaging winds in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.

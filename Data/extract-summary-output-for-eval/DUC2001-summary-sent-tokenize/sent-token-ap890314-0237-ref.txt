Abstract:San Antonio, Texas, with a 50% Hispanic population, has become a center for the study of diabetes in Hispanics.
Dr. Ralph DeFronzo left his diabetes research center at Yale University to relocate to the University of Texas at San Antonio to study the local population.
His researchers are reaching out in a mobile home which roams the neighborhoods and tests inhabitants for the disease.
Dr. DeFronzo's researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diet of cheap processed foods, their lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention are the root causes of their predisposition.
They believe education of children may be critical.

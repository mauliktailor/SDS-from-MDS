Abstract:Actress Elizabeth Taylor, 58, is listed in stable condition at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
She was admitted to Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 8 with a sinus infection and was later transferred to St. John's because of a persistent fever and pneumonia.
"She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized," said Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist.
The actress had a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961.
Her health problems started with back problems after falling from a horse when she was 13.
In 1983, she admitted a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers.

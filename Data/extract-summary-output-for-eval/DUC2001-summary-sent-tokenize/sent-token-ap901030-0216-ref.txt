Abstract:Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect the two halves of the undersea rail "Chunnel".
The basic goal of the tunnel is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours, half the time of a car/ferry journey.
A study released last Friday in Paris said the tunnel's completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of Continental Europe.
Some Britons fear an influx of ills from the Continent, ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.
Profits are not expected until the end of the century.

Abstract:On Saturday, British and French workers digging the Channel tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through.
French President Mitterand said, "What a brilliant sign of the vitality of our two countries".
The $16.7-billion Channel tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to London by high-speed train in 3-1/2 hours, including 35 minutes through the tunnel.
It takes 90 minutes by ferry.
The tunnel is viewed positively in France where it is expected to revive economically depressed northern areas.
Many Britons fear drug traffickers will invade their island via the tunnel.

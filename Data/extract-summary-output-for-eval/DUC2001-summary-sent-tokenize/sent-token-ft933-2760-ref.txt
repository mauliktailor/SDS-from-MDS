Abstract:Grassroots environmental organizations, helped by economic sluggishness and regular corporate layoff announcements, have fanned anti-NAFTA sentiment to its highest level yet.
They warn NAFTA will undermine environmental protection work and deny it would create 200,000 jobs in the next 5 years.
President Clinton insists global marketplace realities must be faced.
President Carter attacked Perot as a rich demagogue, Bush praised Mexican President Salinas, and Ford said immigrants would overrun the US without work at home.
Government agencies were instructed to boost NAFTA in public forums.
House Speaker Tom Foley says much of what people fear will happen more quickly without NAFTA than with it.

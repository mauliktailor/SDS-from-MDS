Abstract:Thousands are preparing to witness the July 11 total eclipse of the sun.
Talismans of all sorts, protective viewing lenses and "power vortex" energy gathering crystals are being sold at locations along the eclipse's path.
Meanwhile, authorities in the primary viewing areas, Mexico's Baja California Sur and the big island of Hawaii are concerned that the infrastructure may not be adequate to accommodate the expected crowds.
Hawaii is expecting 30,000 more tourists than the normal 18,000 for this time of year.
Transportation systems will be strained.
Further, everyone is being warned extensively about serious eye damage caused by improper viewing.

Abstract:Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the help of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said on Monday.
In a prepared statement, Miss Taylor doctors said she was admitted to St. Johns Hospital last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit.
Miss Taylor's four children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding were with her at the hospital.
Dr. John Mohler, of the USC School of Medicine said the biopsy will dictate what therapy to use.

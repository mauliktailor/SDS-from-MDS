Abstract:Scientists are uncertain of the cause or means of transmission of "Mad cow disease" which has killed 10,000 cattle, adversely affecting the market for British beef and raising fears about eating beef.
The British government has taken steps to stop the spread of the disease, while compensating owners for animals destroyed, and assuring the public that there is little chance of risk to human health.
Nevertheless, several countries have imposed an embargo on the export of cattle from Britain.
Two dozen cases of a human disease related to Mad Cow disease were reported in Britain last year.

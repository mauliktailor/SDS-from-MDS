Abstract:"Mad cow disease" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE), has been found in Britain's sparsely scattered antelope population, including elands, kuru and an Arabian oryx.
In all, six species other than cattle have been confirmed with the disease over the past three years.
There has also been a pronounced increase in the number of sheep affected by the ovine form of the disease ("scrapie") with 894 cases diagnosed in 1991 compared to just 348 in 1990.
Since 1989 the condition has been confirmed in 23 cats and 29 goats.
There is not sufficient data to conclude how the disease is spread.

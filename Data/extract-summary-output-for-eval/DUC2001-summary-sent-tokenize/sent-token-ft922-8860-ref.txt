Abstract:\011 Henceforth, the World Bank will tie loan volume to efforts by a receiving country to fight poverty.
This new emphasis will make the aim of alleviation of poverty a central objective by the bank in the 1990's.
The Bank said that poverty assessments by country will be available within two years.
The assessments will allow the receiving country and the World Bank to collaborate in a joint effort at poverty reduction.
The new directive rewards a government with larger loans for a stronger commitment to poverty reduction; a weaker commitment to poverty reduction will warrant less support.

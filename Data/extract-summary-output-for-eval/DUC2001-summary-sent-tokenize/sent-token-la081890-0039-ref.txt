Abstract:Marathon runner Alphonce Swai is continuing his comeback bid by entering the upcoming America's Finest City HomeFed Half Marathon.
Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania is a recovering alcoholic.
Swai began his comeback by entering the Trib10k race but finished a poor 16th.
He has won two races since then, the Coronado Half Marathon and the Goodwill Games 10k run in Seattle.
He was able to achieve victory in the Goodwill Games despite his taking a wrong turn.
Swai believes the upcoming race will be a difficult one in that the runner who paces himself will win.

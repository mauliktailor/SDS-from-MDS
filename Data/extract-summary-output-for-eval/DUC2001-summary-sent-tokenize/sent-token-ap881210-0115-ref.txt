Abstract:A United States Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt attack jet crashed Thursday, killing seven people on the ground while cutting a wide swath through a working class neighborhood in the West German town of Remscheid.
Air Force officials could not explain why the aircraft crashed.
On Saturday citizens of Remscheid marched in protest, and asked for an end to low level flight training.
West German officials are worried that the crash would have an adverse affect on the dwindling support for defense issues.
West German skies are crowded with military flights, and even before Thursday's crash, 12 major accidents had befallen NATO aircraft this year.

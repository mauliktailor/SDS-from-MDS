Abstract:The Kansas City police have suffered a string of complaints about excessive force and racism.
Most recently a young stockbroker, was shot dead by a police officer who entered the victim's apartment at 3:30 a.m. looking for a prowler.
It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police this year.
In June several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground.
In May another black clergyman was hit on the head with a shotgun by a white officer as he lay on the ground.
Earlier this year four officers riddled a man brandishing a barbecue fork with 15 bullets, killing him.

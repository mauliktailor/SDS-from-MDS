Abstract:
The MD82 Northwest Airline plane that crashed on takeoff August 16 in Detroit had two previous incidents of engine failure, and was forced to land in 1985 and 1986 following power loss in an engine.
Cause of this crash has not been ascertained but engine failure seems likely.
154 were killed; a surviving child is in critical condition.
The plane had a heavy fuel load and had ten more passengers on board than its seat limit.
Engines of the type on the MD82 have had problems in the past and the FBI is investigating reports of engine tampering.

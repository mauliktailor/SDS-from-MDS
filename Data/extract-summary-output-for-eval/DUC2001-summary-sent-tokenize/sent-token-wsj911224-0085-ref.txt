Abstract:
Robert Barro discusses his surprise that some free market advocates, with their faith in the self-interested consumer, support term limits.
The free marketers claim incumbent politicians have an unfair advantage, 95% of the incumbents were re-elected, and a citizen Congress would result in better government.
Barro believes decreasing the excessive incentive of maintaining a legislator's seniority status may be a better solution.
Legislative branch term limits are an attempt to shift power back to the executive branch, now subjected to limits.
Barro believes ending executive limits would be a better solution, especially since there is no evidence that they improved governing.

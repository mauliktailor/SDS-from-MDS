Abstract:Results of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine show that individuals infected with the AIDS virus, especially drug users, are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis.
Only about 10 percent of the general populace who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ever develop the disease, but the risk is much greater for those who carry the latent tuberculosis bacteria and then contract AIDS.
Not only are they at greater risk themselves but, because tuberculosis is more easily passed on than AIDs, they can transmit it to health care workers, caseworkers and others.

Abstract:The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season begins amid warnings that the last two years may have been harbingers of a new era of destructive storms.
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report notes that the coastal areas from Maine to Texas will experience a 60% growth in population and are ill prepared to handle a hurricane emergency.
Predictions of increased hurricane activity are based on studies, atmospheric low pressure waves, and increased rainfall trends in West Africa near the breeding grounds for most hurricanes.
There are five categories of hurricanes: Category 1 has sustained winds from 74-95 mph; Category 5 has top winds greater than 155 mph.

Abstract:While some Democrats claim term limits are a "right-wing" crusade, this author (John Fund) believes support from the liberal and Democratic sphere is increasing.
Polls show Americans back term limits by 75% to 21% nationwide.
One reason is that term limits would open up politics to people--minorities and women--now excluded from office.
Some past Democratic leaders were cited as supporting the idea, but the party "apparatchiks" remain against it.
Some journalists favor term limits voicing a need for new blood and the end of professional politicians.
Fund does not believe enacting term limits will be easy.

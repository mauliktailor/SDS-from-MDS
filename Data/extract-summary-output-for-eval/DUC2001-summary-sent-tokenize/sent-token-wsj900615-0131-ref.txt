Abstract:Britain risks failing to take full advantage of the cross-channel "Chunnel" due to the Thatcher government's announcement yesterday that it would not help fund a high-speed rail line between London and the tunnel.
This fuels fears that the country's creaky transportation system will isolate Britain.
The lack of the high-speed rail link, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits.
The consortium formed to build the link asked the government for a financial contribution, which the government says involves "unacceptable" risks to the taxpayer.
Industrialists fear poor links will isolate them from the European Community's single market.

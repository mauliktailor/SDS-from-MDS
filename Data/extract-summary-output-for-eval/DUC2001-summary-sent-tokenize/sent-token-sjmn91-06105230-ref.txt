Abstract:The Boston Marathon has a storied past.
It has produced many of the world's top marathon runners.
In the past, this marathon has turned into a speed duel and a race of attrition.
The upcoming version may not be any different.
Records for checkpoints along the route have fallen at an alarming rate.
In 1990, all 11 checkpoint records were broken through the first 20 miles.
This year's race is filled with well-known entrants, including Gelindo Bordin who ran the second fastest time in race history last year, and Ingrid Kristiansen, a 35-year-old Norwegian woman who holds the world's record.

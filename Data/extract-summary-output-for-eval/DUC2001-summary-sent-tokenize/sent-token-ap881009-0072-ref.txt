Abstract:Angella Issajenko, a Canadian Olympic sprinter, said that Ben Johnson knowingly took steroids.
She said that Dr. Jamie Astaphan provided the steroids with the knowledge of sprint coach Charlie Francis of the Mazda Optimist Track to which both she and Johnson belong.
Issajenko acknowledged that she also took the steroids.
Johnson says he never knowingly took illegal drugs and Astaphan said he has never administered stanozolol, the banned drug found in the sprinter's urine sample after the race.
Francis said the test result could only be explained "by deliberate manipulation of the testing process".

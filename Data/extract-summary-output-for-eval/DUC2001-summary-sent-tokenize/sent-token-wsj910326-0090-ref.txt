Abstract:John Kelley is in training for his 60th Boston Marathon.
The 83-year old icon of the marathon world is the object of attention for his endurance.
The 26- mile, 385 yard course will claim many a runner but Kelley hopes to finish the grinding course as he did last year.
Kelley is a medical wonder and he continues to confound the experts over his physical condition.
Originally he started running after work 60 years ago in order to relax and began entering the Boston Marathon.
He won in 1933 and 1945 and was a runner-up seven times.
Experts predict that, even at the age of 83, he will finish ahead of most of the 13,000 other runners entered in the race.

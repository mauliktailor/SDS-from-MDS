Abstract:The Census head count will begin on April 1, 1990.
These figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats and to distribute federal aid to local governments.
Aliens have been counted in the past but military personal stationed overseas have not.
The Census Department and the Department of Defense are devising a plan to count the military and determine which states may count them.
Census officials contend that they have no way to determine who is in the country legally.
It would be difficult to get aliens to tell the truth or participate in the census at all if they were asked about their status.

Abstract:Nationwide opinion polls about the Channel tunnel show convincingly that: the English do not want a fixed link; they like ferries and their island story; they are afraid of long, dark tunnels underwater, and of rabies, rats and terrorists crawling through; not to mention European undesirables.
However, the tunnel will be a symbol of European unity.
Moreover, it will reinforce historically dominant trading links (London - Frankfurt - Milan), bolstering Northern Europe as an economic entity challenged by a strengthened Mediterranean "sunbelt".
For the rest of us, it means that you can climb aboard and whiz from London to Paris in three hours.

Abstract:A United States Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and burned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight.
The aircraft was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at Alconbury.
The plane crashed 25 miles north of Cambridge.
The fate of the pilot is not known.
Another A-10 Thunderbolt crashed in Germany two weeks ago, and on the same day as the German crash, still another A-10 went down in Arizona.
Despite the recent spate of accidents, statistics show that the A-10 is the safest fighter or attack plane in the inventory.

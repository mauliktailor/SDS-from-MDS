Abstract:A United States Air Force F-16C fighter, on a routine training flight from Misawa Air Base in Northern Japan, crashed in a remote forested area in Iwate Prefecture.
The pilot, Major Wyman Vanedoe, was the sole occupant of the aircraft.
He bailed out and was evacuated back to his base in a Japanese rescue helicopter.
About 50 F-16s at Misawa belong to the 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and another of the squadron's jets had crashed into the Pacific Ocean in March 1987.
That pilot also successfully bailed out and was rescued.

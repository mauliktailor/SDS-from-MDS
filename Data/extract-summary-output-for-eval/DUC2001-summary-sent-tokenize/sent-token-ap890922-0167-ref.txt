Abstract:Super computers, satellites, and forecaster expertise predicted the destructive path of Hurricane Hugo allowing people time to flee the South Carolina coast.
The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting its intensity which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just before it slammed into Charleston.
Forecasters analyze super computer predictions, satellite data, history of similar storms, and the current path of the hurricane to determine its track; then they make an educated guess.
The accuracy of satellite pictures is improving each year so long range forecasting should become more precise.

The jet was assigned to Training Squadron 19 at the Meridian, Mississippi Naval Air Station.
Five were killed and others injured.
Several short-lived fires broke out on the World War II-class carrier, the only one used exclusively for flight training.
Two aircraft on the flight deck suffered major damage.
Helicopters took the injured to hospitals on the mainland.

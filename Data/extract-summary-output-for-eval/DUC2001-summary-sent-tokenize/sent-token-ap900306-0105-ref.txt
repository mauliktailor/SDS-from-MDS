Abstract:
The Senate today confirmed Clarence Thomas as a judge to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
He was confirmed by a voice vote.
One of the most highly placed blacks in the Reagan and Bush administrations, Thomas has been serving as the Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Civil rights leaders have been divided on his nomination.
He is a critic of affirmative action and quotas.
Conservatives have praised Thomas' service on the EEOC, but liberals have criticized him for his failure to act on 15,000 age-discrimination cases.

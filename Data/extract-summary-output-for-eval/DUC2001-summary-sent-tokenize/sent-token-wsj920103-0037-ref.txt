Abstract:In response to a "free market" stand against government imposition of term limits, this author (Edward Crane) claims two reasons for term limits that economists should appreciate.
One, the less time a politician is in Washington the less his common sense will be corrupted by the "cult to ruling".
Two, few individuals who want to spend the rest of their life in Washington will be elected.
Crane feels Congress needs experience in living in the "real world," but productive citizens do not want to commit 10 to 15 years to politics.
Six-year limits on House service could be viewed as only a leave of absence from real careers.

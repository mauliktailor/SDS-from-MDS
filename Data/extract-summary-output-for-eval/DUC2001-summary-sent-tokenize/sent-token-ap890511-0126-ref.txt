Abstract:
In May federal health officials announced that the rate of tuberculosis for those in prison might be more than three times as great as for those on the outside.
In some states it is even higher.
In New Jersey, for example, it is 11 times higher.
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease, and those in close contact with an active carrier of tuberculosis are at greater risk.
This is a big issue in prisons where there often is overcrowding, poor circulation of air and an environment conducive to the spread of contagious diseases.

Abstract:Deaths of two elderly blacks in a drug raid gone awry followed 10 days later by a scuffle at a downtown hotel have aroused a demand for an outside review of the Minneapolis Police Department.
The deaths resulted from a fire started when police hurled a stun grenade into the apartment of the deceased.
In the hotel incident, police, responding to a complaint of a loud party, are alleged to have used the term "nigger" and to have beaten some of those arrested.
The president of the Minneapolis Urban League says that police brutality has been a problem there for years.

Abstract:A single-engine Cessna 177 has crashed in Janice, Mississippi, carrying Representative Larkin Smith of that state and his pilot to their deaths.
They were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport after Smith had thrown out the first ball at the Dixie Youth World Series baseball tournament.
The plane cut a swath 300 feet long through the woods where the wreckage was found.
Searchers had spent all of Sunday night combing the woods, but the plane was finally spotted from the air.
No cause has been determined.
Smith was the second congressman in a week to die in a plane crash.
Wreckage of Representative Mickey Leland's plane was located on the same day Representative Smith was killed.

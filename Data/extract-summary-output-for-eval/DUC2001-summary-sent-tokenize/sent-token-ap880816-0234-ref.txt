Abstract:An army death squad, the Rodrigo Franco Command, has vowed to kill a Shining Path member or sympathizer for every person slain by the guerrillas, according to the District Attorney of Ayachucho, Peru.
He is investigating charges that the Command killed dozens of peasants in May and was threatened by the Command if he continued the investigation.
The Shining Path was accused of killing two policemen and wounding three on Sunday near Pucallpa.
The Peruvian government claims the Shining Path has killed more than 15,000 people and caused $10 million in property damage since fighting began 8 years ago.

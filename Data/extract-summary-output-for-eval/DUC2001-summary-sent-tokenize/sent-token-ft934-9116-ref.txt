Abstract:After Vice President Gore's debate victory over Ross Perot, a poll found NAFTA support up from 34% to 57%.
US NAFTA opponents believe fear of job and investment losses to Mexico will outweigh any new enthusiasm.
A survey of executives of medium-sized companies in Canada, Mexico and the US showed a majority supporting NAFTA.
The Mexican congress criticized Perot's claims -- that Mexicans were badly treated, oppressed and mostly living in poverty while 34 families owned half the country -- as ignorant, offensive, and without foundation.
The anti-NAFTA whip announced he had enough votes to defeat NAFTA but wanted a safe margin.

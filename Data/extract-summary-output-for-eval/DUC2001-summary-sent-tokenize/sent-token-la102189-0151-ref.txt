Abstract:The Social Services director in Orange County wants all residents in the county to be counted in the 1990 Census.
He will ask the Board of Supervisors to pass a resolution supporting his position.
If the approximate 200,000 illegal aliens were not counted, the county would loose an estimated $56 million a year in federal revenue and lose representatives in Congress.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate and House agreed that illegal aliens should be counted.
Before Thursday, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens.
The House had twice rejected efforts to exclude aliens.

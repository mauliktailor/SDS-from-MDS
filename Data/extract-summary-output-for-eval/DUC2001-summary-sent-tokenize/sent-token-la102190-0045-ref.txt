Abstract:Californians were asked what would state government be like by 1996 if two propositions to limit terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators, on California's November ballot, are passed.
Individuals felt there would be all new faces and the people would have more control, politics would not be a profession, expertise would come from the citizenry, and candidates would be more dependent on the party for financing and less dependent of the special interests.
On the other side, individuals felt it would be clear that amateurs can't handle the complex job, everyone is a lame duck from the beginning, minorities would lose, and power would go to the executive branch and bureaucrats.

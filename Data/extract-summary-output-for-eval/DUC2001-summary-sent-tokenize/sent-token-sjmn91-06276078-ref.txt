Abstract:A study covering the outbreak of tuberculosis in an unidentified government building found that the number infected could have been cut in half with better ventilation.
Forty- seven workers in the building, and 27 of them contacted tuberculosis, but many of the 27 did not work in close proximity to the infected carrier.
New office buildings, built with an eye to lower heating and cooling costs, are sleek and airtight.
Stale air is recirculated with not enough intake of fresh air, and such can be a factor in the spread of tuberculosis.
Poor ventilation is often present in homeless shelter, prisons and hospitals.

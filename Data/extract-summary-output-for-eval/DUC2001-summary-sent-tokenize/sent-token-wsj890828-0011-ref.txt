Abstract:The Senate voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment.
The Census Bureau is planning to count all residents in the nation and estimates that it counted about 2 million illegal immigrants in the 1980 Census.
That gave California and New York one extra seat each.
Hispanic organizations are worried about the congressional campaign.
They fear that it will make it more difficult for the Census Bureau to get an accurate count in areas where some Hispanics and blacks already appear to be reluctant to provide information.
The 106 million census forms could be reprinted but wording a question so those illegal immigrants answer accurately would be a challenge.

Abstract:A number of years ago, Ethiopian athletes came out of Africa and surprised the world by winning three consecutive Olympic marathon gold medals.
That domination appears to be happening again.
Now, Abebe Mekonnen, an Ethiopean policeman, has won the prestigious Boston Marathon for 1989.
Two other Ethiopians were in the race, finishing ninth and 18th.
In two days, runners from Ethiopia have won three major world marathons.
Another Ethiopian is the favorite in the upcoming London marathon.
Ethiopians train in a mountainous area of their country and it is this altitude that enhances their performance.

Abstract:
A fresh oil sheen has seeped from the ruptured Exxon Valdez making a complete clean-up impossible.
The vessel is now undergoing temporary repairs 30 miles from the rupture site.
The Alaskan Senate passed bills to add to state's spill response fund, prevent companies from deducting spill costs from oil production taxes, develop state contingency plans, establish a spill response team, and create a commission to investigate the Exxon Valdez spill.
It is unlikely that the House would approve the bill before adjournment.

Abstract:Population experts say that little would change in allocating seats in Congress if two sides get their way in trying to force changes in the 1990 census.
One group has filed suit to ignore the aliens while other groups want the final census count to be increased to account for people who may be overlooked or undercounted.
William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population Reference Bureau, said "the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia".
If aliens are counted, California is estimated to gain six seats with four additional seats going to Florida and three to Texas.

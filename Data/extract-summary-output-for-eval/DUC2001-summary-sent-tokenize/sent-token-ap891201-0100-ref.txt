Abstract:The Slovenian government banned a pro-Serbian rally in Lubljana on Friday, calling it organized by Serbian politicians trying to oust the Slovenian leadership, including Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek, a Slovene.
Serbia reacted by severing political and economic contacts with Slovenia.
The Slovenian government called the Serbian economic boycott an attempt to oust Slovenia from Yugoslavia, which it would never permit.
100 people gathered on Friday and 13 were arrested.
Economic decline has increased friction between Slovenia, which advocates regional autonomy and legalized opposition groups, and the communist leadership of Serbia, which insists on a centralized federation with the Communist Party the only official party.

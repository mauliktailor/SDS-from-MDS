Abstract:The "Chunnel" between Britain and France is half dug, scheduled to open in three years on time, but is almost 60% over budget, embroiled in contractor dispute over responsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns, and scrambling for more investment money after the British government refused to finance a rail link.
The British public shows little enthusiasm for the Chunnel, fearing it will import rabies, terrorists and invading armies.
The French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link, enthusiastic because the tunnel surfaces in one of their more depressed areas.
Rural southeast English are reluctant to have high-speed trains screaming through their back yards.

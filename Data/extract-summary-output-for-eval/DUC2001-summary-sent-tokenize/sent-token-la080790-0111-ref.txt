Abstract:On March 15, 1988 detective Clayton Searle was at the Los Angeles International Airport looking for a drug courier.
He spotted a man making a phone call and, according to the suspect, grabbed his shoulder, spun him around and asked him to identify himself.
Then Searle grabbed the suspect by the neck, they fell to the floor, the officer put a knee on the suspect's back, and handcuffed him.
The suspect was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman.
Morgan is suing in federal court claiming that he suffered this treatment because he is black and fit a certain "profile" used by narcotics officers.

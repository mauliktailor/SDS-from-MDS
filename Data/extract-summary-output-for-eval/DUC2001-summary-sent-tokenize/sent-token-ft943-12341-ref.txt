Abstract:Japan, one of the most earthquake-prone areas of the world, supports an early- warning center, monitored constantly to report any unusual seismic activity in the Tokai area.
Elaborate plans have been made to evacuate danger areas, reroute traffic and close schools and businesses if experts feel a quake is imminent.
Although most other countries have given up trying to predict quakes, Japan continues to spend 2.5 million dollars yearly to support this effort, which covers only a limited area.
The source of the danger is the Suruga Trough, a deep off-shore trench which forms a boundary between two tectonic plates.
It last ruptured in 1854, and evidence is that significant strain has accumulated since the last big earthquake.

Abstract:One tactic used by gun lobbyists to counter any proposed legislation for gun control is to mobilize its forces at the grass roots level with petitions.
Another tactic is to launch verbal attacks such as the one against Congressman DeConcini, a former opponent of gun control measures who had changed his views.
Leading the gun lobby charge is the National Rifle Association.
It continues to use its interpretation of the Second Amendment to the Constitution as the cornerstone of its opposition.
Gun crimes, however, continue to bring more public pressure against the NRA and for gun control legislation.

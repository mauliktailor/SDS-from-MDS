Abstract:Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez after nearly 1M barrels of oil were pumped to smaller tankers and air was forced into the Valdez tanks.
Clean-up from the spill continued as the oil slick was estimated to affect an area the size of Delaware.
Alaska Governor Cowper said the coast Guard could better handle the clean-up than Exxon.
James Hazelwood, captain of the Valdez, who had been found to be legally drunk and was fired by Exxon, surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York City.
Released on $500,000 bail he may not waive extradition to Alaska.

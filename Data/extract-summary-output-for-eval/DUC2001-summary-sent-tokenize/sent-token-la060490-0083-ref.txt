Abstract:West Germany has joined France in a ban on British beef imports due to concern over "mad cow disease" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE).
Despite assurances from the British government that the beef is safe, some are skeptical and the price of British beef is dropping.
British officials believe that France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales.
European Community commissioners have also protested the import ban.
On May 11 it was reported that a Siamese cat had died from a form of BSE and the press went wild suggesting that if cats can get it people can too.

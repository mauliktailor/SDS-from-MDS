Abstract:
With winds of 175 mph, Gilbert is the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western Hemisphere.
The barometric pressure at Gilbert's center measured 26.13 inches, the lowest ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
With storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the center, Gilbert was also one of the largest.
Gilbert is only one of three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since detailed records have been kept.
Gilbert's storm surge, the great dome of water that follows the eye and accounts of 90% of fatalities, is only 8-12 feet, less that Camille's which was 25 feet.

Abstract:
Carl Lewis said he knew that Ben Johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs after their 100-meter final at the Seoul Olympics.
Lewis believed that after all the preliminary heats that Johnson would not have been able to perform as he did without taking something.
Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson's drug test.
A Canadian coach said that Johnson might have drunk contaminated beer, given to aid in urinalysis, just before the test.
Supposedly, an unidentified man who sat near the beer talked with Lewis.
Lewis' attorney said the charge was ludicrous.
Johnson had earlier taken drugs to induce growth of muscle tissue.

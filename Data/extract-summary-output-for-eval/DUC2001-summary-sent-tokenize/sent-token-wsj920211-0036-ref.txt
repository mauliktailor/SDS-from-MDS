Abstract:
The author of an article in the Wall Street Journal believes that opponents of gun control write passionately but do not read well.
He forms this opinion from some "Letters to the Editor" he received in response to his article recommending sensible gun control.
One letter writer accuses him of wanting to remove all guns from American citizens through total regulation.
The author vigorously denies making any such statement.
Other writers accuse him of distorting the Second Amendment on the "..right to keep and bear arms".
The author simply maintains that the Amendment is not a barrier to gun control.

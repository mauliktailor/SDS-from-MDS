Abstract:For two months last summer, residents of the northeastern corner area of Yellowstone National Park were threatened to be burned out by forest fires.
Eventually, millions of dollars, thousands of man-hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved the area.
The unprecedented fire season burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the National Park, causing residents to worry about what is happening beneath the snow this winter.
Reportedly, some wildfires have buried themselves in roots of trees and grasses and smoldered all winter, only to pop up through the snow in the spring.

Abstract:Writers of "Letters to the Editor" of the Wall Street Journal, responding to Michael Gartner's article "Tell Me a Good Reason for Handguns," take the author to task for ignoring key facts.
One writer comments that 99.6 percent of handguns are not involved in crimes.
Clearly, says the writer, it is not gun control but crime control and further, that criminals ignore gun control laws.
Another writer believes that Gartner is intent on removing handguns from society.
A third writer suggests that Gartner distorts the Second Amendment when he claims that it refers to the arming of a militia.

Abstract:The unofficial tornado season runs from April through June in Texas and other Tornado Alley states.
From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118 tornadoes in Texas per year.
A tornado watch means conditions are suitable for a tornado to develop.
A warning means one has already been spotted.
Plan what you'll do if caught in a tornado.
If at home, go to the basement.
If in a car, take cover in the nearest ditch or depression.
Flying debris causes most fatalities in a tornado, so, squat down, cover your head and present a low profile.

Abstract:
At a time when there is some hope for the control of the AIDS epidemic, we are seeing a large increase in the incidence of tuberculosis.
In New York City tuberculosis declined from 1960 to 1977, but by 1990, it has increased to the 1960 level.
Many of the new cases occurred when individuals who had AIDS and lost the ability to suppress the latent tuberculosis that they might have carried for years.
The rise in the tuberculosis actually began in the late 1970s, probably because of the large increase in the number of homeless, a group at great risk.

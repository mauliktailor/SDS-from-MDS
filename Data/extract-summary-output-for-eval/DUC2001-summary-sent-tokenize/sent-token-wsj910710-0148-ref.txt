Abstract:The Christopher Commission, appointed after the videotaped March 3 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles policemen, has issued a report that paints a picture of brutality and racism in the police department, calls for the resignation of Chief Gates, and could prompt changes in law enforcement nationwide.
Nearly one- quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that "racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community".
One of the commission members commented "As troubling as some of our findings are...
they are not unique to Los Angeles".

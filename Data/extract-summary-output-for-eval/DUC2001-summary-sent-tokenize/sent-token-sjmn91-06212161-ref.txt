Abstract:Hispanics in the United States are two to three times more likely to develop diabetes than the general population.
Heredity and diet seem to be important factors in a disease that affects 14- 21% of Hispanics and up to 40% of those 64 to 75 years of age, compared to 7% of all Americans.
Heredity, a high fat diet and obesity are predisposing factors, especially in those with American Indian ancestry.
Management includes diet, exercise and medication.
The St. Louis Health Center in Morgan Hill, California is sponsoring a diabetes management program for Hispanic diabetics.

Abstract:Residents of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and nearby islands were warned to bolt down everything loose and stock up on food and water to prepare for Hurricane Dean.
Dean was upgraded from a tropical storm to the second hurricane of the Atlantic season.
In San Juan, shoppers formed long lines in supermarkets and workers boarded up windows of the governor's mansion and stores in the tourist district.
Forecasters expected the storm to hit land first in Barbuda, the eastern most Leeward Island.
In Florida, a hurricane specialist called Dean a small hurricane with hurricane force winds confined within 25 miles of its center.

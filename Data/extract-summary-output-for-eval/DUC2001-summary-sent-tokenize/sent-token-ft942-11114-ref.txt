Abstract:The official opening of the Channel tunnel this year promises to help revitalize the northwest regions of Belgium although the country's biggest ports will suffer a loss in traffic.
Flanders, the area most likely to benefit, has suffered rapid increases in unemployment.
Two main areas for development are: firstly, increasing traffic as holiday makers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel opening in Calais and, secondly, tourism.
West Flanders is home to some of the best-known World War 1 battlefields and large, open green spaces.
The biggest advantage is the close cooperation between national and federal authorities with French and UK counterparts.

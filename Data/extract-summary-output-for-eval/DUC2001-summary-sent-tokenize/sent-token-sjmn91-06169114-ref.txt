Abstract:
Many people in Miami worry about the "Big One", a devastating hurricane that could cause untold damage to the city. "
Surprise" hurricanes like the Galveston hurricane in 1900 that killed 6000 are unlikely, but scientists expect a major hurricane to hit within 75 miles of Miami every eight years.
If a really major storm were to hit Miami today, it would be totally different from the big hurricane that hit Miami in 1926.
A storm today with winds topping 155 mph could cause water levels to reach 9 feet on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami and over 13 feet in low lying areas south of the city.

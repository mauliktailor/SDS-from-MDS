Abstract:When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to become the second black to serve on the Supreme Court, he named a man whose views are at the opposite end of the spectrum from those of Thurgood Marshall, the man he would succeed.
Thomas was only five years old when Marshall, the first black to serve, was appointed to the court.
Marshall helped to create the world in which Thomas grew up.
Thomas opposes affirmative action and quotas, and his views on other issues dear to liberals are largely unknown.
Some Democrats have said they will be diligent in drawing out Thomas' views on controversial issues.

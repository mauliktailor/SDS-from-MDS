Abstract:
A computer study suggests the 1988 drought in the Midwest may have been caused by bands of ocean abnormal temperature near the equator in the Pacific Ocean.
While meteorologists often blame such droughts on the jet stream being north of its usual position, this is not the cause.
In April-June 1988, there were alternating high and low pressure centers across the northern Western Hemisphere preventing the normal flow of weather systems.
Computer modeling suggests that these centers were related to unusual ocean temperature variations observed in the Pacific.
If valid, monitoring ocean temperature may provide forewarning of droughts.

Abstract:
At the end of a high-speed chase in Santa Clara County a police officer takes his baton and brutally hits the suspect on the back eight times, kicks him in the face, picks him up by the shoulders and slams his face into the pavement.
The suspect suffers a dislocated shoulder, a concussion, and numerous cuts, bruises and contusions.
The officer's report states that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall from his bike.
None of the back-up officers reported any brutality.
All too often a code of silence blocks prosecution of police brutality.
That is why we need citizen review boards.

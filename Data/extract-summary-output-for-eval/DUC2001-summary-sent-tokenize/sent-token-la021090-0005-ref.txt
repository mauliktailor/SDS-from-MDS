Abstract:There appears to be a trend in the U.S. toward the implementation of gun controls.
A recent media report indicates that 87 percent of gun owners themselves favor a seven-day waiting period for handguns; three quarters favor registration of semi-automatic weapons and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns.
The Second Amendment to the Constitution, however, continues to be the thorn in the side of any legal effort toward gun control.
Pro-gun advocates accept the wording of the amendment at face value, that is, a right to bear arms.
Gun control advocates attempt to put the amendment in its 1792 context in defining its meaning.

Abstract:Ernesto Beatriz Martinez was a late participant for the San Diego International Marathon.
Martinez had to make his way on a 12-1/2 hour bus ride from his home to Tijuana and then across the border to San Diego.
He arrived just in time for the start of the race.
Martinez, in an amazing feat of endurance, won the 26-mile plus race in 2:16:12.
The women's division winner was Marie Rollins, a former Irish Olympic team member.
Martinez and Rollins received $5,000 each for their victory.
Martinez commented that his purse would help him to repay his family and friends for the trip.

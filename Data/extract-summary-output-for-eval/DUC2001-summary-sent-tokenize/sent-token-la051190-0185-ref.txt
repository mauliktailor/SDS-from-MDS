Abstract:Pneumonia-Stricken actress Elizabeth Taylor has suffered complications in her fifth week of hospitalization and doctors
say she will be hospitalized six more weeks for intravenous therapy.
Bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection her doctors said today have complicated the recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with a viral pneumonia. "
Miss Taylor has a resolving, newly acquired bacterial pneumonia secondary to her hospital stay at St. John's Hospital and Health Center," the doctors said.
Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than the viral pneumonia Taylor initially contracted because antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses.

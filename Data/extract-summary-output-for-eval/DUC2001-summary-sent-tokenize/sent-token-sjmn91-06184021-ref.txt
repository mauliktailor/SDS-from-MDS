Abstract:Speaking on national television on Monday, Clarence Thomas praised his grandparents for teaching him to rely on himself and instilling the values that allowed him to succeed in a hostile environment.
Their hard-working grandparents took in Clarence and his brother after their own father deserted the family and their mother remarried.
Clarence was seven years old and his grandfather taught him perseverance, discipline and the value of hard work.
The grandfather enrolled him in a segregated Catholic school in Savannah, and Thomas also credited the nuns for reinforcing the discipline preached by his grandfather.

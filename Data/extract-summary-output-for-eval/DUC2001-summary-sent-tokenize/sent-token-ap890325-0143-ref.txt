Abstract:The biggest oil spill in US history created a slick seven miles long and seven wide in Prince William Sound from 240,000 barrels of crude from the Exxon Valdez.
The Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin called this a major environmental catastrophe and that clean-up equipment at the site was grossly inadequate.
Alaska has a plan for action within five hours of a spill but it took hours longer and insufficient equipment was employed initially.
A Greenpeace spokesman said the whole food chain could be affected.
A Coast Guard spokesman said some blood-alcohol tests were given to crew but no results yet available.
National Transportation Safety Board officials were expected on site soon.

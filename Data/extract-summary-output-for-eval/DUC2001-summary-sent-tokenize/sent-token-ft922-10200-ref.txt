Abstract:Ten months after the Christopher Commission called for the resignation of Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, he has finally agreed to step down.
His decision was the result of his force's helplessness when riots broke out after the four officers who beat Rodney King were acquitted.
Gates's departure is overdue.
Six m nths after the Christopher Commission reported that a significant minority of the Los Angeles police force "repetitively misuse force," of the 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutality complaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from field duty.
28 remained untouched.

Abstract:Patience paid off for the two winners of the Chicago Marathon on Sunday.
Heat and humidity, as well as strong winds, sapped the strength of the runners, however.
Paul Davies-Hale, and Englishman and Lisa Weidenbach from Washington state both held back in a conservative race, saving their energy for the last few miles.
Davies-Hale's winning time was 2:11:25, the second slowest in this marathon's history.
Weidenbach's time was a very respectable 2:28:15.
Weather conditions for the race were poor, with temperatures in the mid-60's, 53 percent humidity, and strong winds.
Forty degree temperatures with cloud cover are ideal.

Abstract:T.K. Wetherel does not believe that the Federalists Alexander Hamilton and James Madison supported term limits.
Limits were included in the failed Articles of Confederation and rejected by the Constitutional Convention and the First Congress.
Hamilton reasoned term limitations on the presidency would diminish the inducements to good behavior.
Madison wrote that members of Congress in long-standing could become masters of the public business.
Not the Federalists, but the out-of-power opposition wanted limits.
With term limits, key legislation, such as the 1850 Compromise and civil- rights bills, may not have been enacted and Medicare and Social Security may not have been protected.

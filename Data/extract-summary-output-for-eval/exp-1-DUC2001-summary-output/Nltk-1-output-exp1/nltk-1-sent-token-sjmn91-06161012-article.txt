"The effect of it -- the view of seeing the sundisappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappearand having the birds stop singing
-- it's miraculous," said Irving Hochman, amember of the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers.
The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds --at
the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast.
Butafter enveloping the Big Island and then slicing across southern Baja, themoon's shadow will cross the Gulf of California and race across the southernflank of Mexico and down the west coast of Central America.

Introduction:
Nature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipseof the sun, one that'll be among the longest this century.
Unfortunately, you canprobably forget about seeing it, because, unless you get lucky, you can't getthere from here anymore.
Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots, because --statistically at least -- they offer the best chance of cloudless skies.
And the bestviewing spots are virtually in California's back yard:
The Big Island ofHawaii and the southern Baja California peninsula.
Two of Mexico'sbiggest cities, Gaudalajara and Mexico City, lie in the path of totality.
Inthe Bay Area, the moon will cover about 55 percent of the sun's surface.
Among fans of the heavens, a solar eclipse inspires awe, fascination andgrandeur.
Another possibility is to search aroundfor groups making the trip that have had late cancellations, as the Dei Rossisdid.
With the eclipse, there's concern theoverbooking could be particularly bad, especially on inter-island flights inHawaii.
They've had to get flights intosomewhere else, like Honolulu, and do a short hop to where they want to be. "
Learning of the eclipse only a month ago, they began calling travel
agents.
"It's an event, and it rarely, rarelyhappens.
Puerto Vallarta, a resort city, is only a short distanceaway.
Mexicanauthorities will have a checkpoint from July 7-15 at Guerrero Negro, abouthalfway down the peninsula.
Firm estimates aren't available, but blotted-out-sun watchers areexpected to number more than 100,000 -- perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 in Hawaii andan equal number in Baja.
"It's romantic images like these that areinspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agentssay.

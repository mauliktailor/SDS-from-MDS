``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of peoplewho would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annualmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followedby a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientistssaid.
He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic,probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the1970s.
Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that anepidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the innercities.
There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis isspreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS,but that is likely, Vermund said.
A number of treatments for AIDSand AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many ofthem are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
In New York City, for example, tuberculosis declined between1960 and 1977, but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 levelagain.
Introduction:
Drugs are now available that can put AIDSpatients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that avaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel ofAIDS experts said Saturday.
``Unless we develop a vaccine, the future of this epidemicworldwide will be extremely grim,'' he said.
Andunlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casualcontact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air.
Theylose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria,which normally would have remained dormant, and tuberculosisappears.

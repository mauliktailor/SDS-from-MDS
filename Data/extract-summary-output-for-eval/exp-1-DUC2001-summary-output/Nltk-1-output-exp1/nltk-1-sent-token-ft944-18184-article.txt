Introduction:
If Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's next president, had any doubts about thedifficulties of reforming Mexico's governing party and the country's corruptjudicial and legal system, the assassination last week of Mr Jose FranciscoRuiz Massieu, the party's number two official, will probably have removedthem.
As if tounderline this pledge, Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the head of the PRIgroup in the Chamber of Deputies and a reformist, was appointed to replaceMr Ruiz Massieu as the party's secretary-general.
Mr Ruiz Massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, afederal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), and MrAbraham Rubio Canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to theGulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas.
Since Mr Ruiz Massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculationthat political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in thekilling six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party'sreform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged toindicate this is the case.
Two newspapers reportedyesterday that Mr Munoz Rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but putthe responsibility on Mr Rubio Canales, who reportedly blames Mr RuizMassieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he iscurrently serving.
Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the presidentof the party, declared on Monday that Mr Munoz Rocha 'never had intellectualinterests, never raised issues of political theory, and was never associatedwith making ideological pronouncements.
Mr Mario Ruiz Massieurecently had arrested Raul Valladares, top lieutenant in the Gulf Cartel andson-in-law of Mr Rubio Canales, the man in the Acapulco jail accused ofjointly plotting the assassination.
This alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a manwith links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by Mr Zedilloto reform his party and the country's criminal justice system will be metwith fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from thesechanges.
Mr Munoz Rocha said he participated in the assassination 'because I wasangry that I had not been supported in my political aspirations'.The ruling party has denied that the crime reflects an internal battlebetween ideological factions in the PRI.
The two allegedly hired the gunman, and other accomplices, according totestimony from one man who has confessed to his role in the killing.

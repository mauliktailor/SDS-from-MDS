Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and BenjaminGilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented thelegislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlledsubstance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
Johnson later stepped up to the microphones and in a quiet voicewith a slight stutter told other athletes not to make the samemistake he did, urging them ``to come forward, to come clean.''
``I'm here to tell the people of this country it's wrong tocheat, not to take it
, it's bad for your health.''
Introduction:   Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knockedoff track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids,says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.
Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids,indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson ``if he comesback and he's clean.''
``But if we act quickly enough torestrict steroid distribution, and to increase the penalties forillicit distribution, we can prevent this plague from spreading.''
However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: ``Idon't understand why Ben Johnson's here.''
The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids bycollege, high school and even junior high school athletes whobelieve the substance will enhance their performance.
I lost my gold medal,'' the Canadiantold reporters as legislation to classify anabolic steroids as acontrolled substance was introduced Thursday.
Watching Johnson was his chief nemesis: Carl Lewis, the man whowas awarded the Olympic gold medals Johnson lost.
Levine referred to the abuse of steroids as ``the silent side ofthe drug disease in this country.''
``I think it's great,''
Lewis said of the legislation.

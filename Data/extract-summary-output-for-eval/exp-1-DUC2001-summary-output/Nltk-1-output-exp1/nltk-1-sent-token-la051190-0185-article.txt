"Miss Taylor has a resolving, newly acquired bacterial pneumonia secondary to her hospital stay at St. John's Hospital and Health Center," the doctors said in Santa Monica through Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam.
"She has also developed a fungemia of Candida albicans (infection in the blood), more commonly referred to as yeast and will be hospitalized for approximately six more weeks for intravenous therapy," the doctors added without elaboration.
The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with a viral pneumonia, has been complicated by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors said today.

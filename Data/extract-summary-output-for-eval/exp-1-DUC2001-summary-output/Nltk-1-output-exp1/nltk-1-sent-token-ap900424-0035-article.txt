While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator,it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G.Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert
whoemphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.
``She is seriously ill,'' her doctors said in a statement.``After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by aventilator.
The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for``Butterfield 8'' and
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' has beenhospitalized more than two weeks.
``It may be that because she is such a prominent person, theyare taking a conservative course,'' he added.
During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylorunderwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help herbreathe.
Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,particularly back troubles from filming of ``National Velvet' in1945, when she fell off a horse.
Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restoreoxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathingdifficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said.

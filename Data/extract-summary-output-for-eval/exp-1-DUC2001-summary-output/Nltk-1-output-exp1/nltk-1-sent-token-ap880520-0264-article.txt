The ministry statement said the federal military council met onMarch 25 and concluded that ``dissident tendencies'' in Sloveniawere part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country'sCommunist government.
It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion ata later meeting between the republic's police authorities andLjubljana's military command.
It published a letter to Slovenia's Communist Party leader MilanKucan from two student unions that said military action had beenplanned earlier this year, including the arrests of ``nonconformistjournalists, writers and officials.''
The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followedreports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina thatthere had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
The plan was blocked byKucan and Stane Dolanc, Slovenia's member in Yugoslavia'scollective presidency, after they were told about it by Sloveniansecurity organizations, the letter said.
Svetozar Visnjic, commander of Ljubljana's military command,dismissed the reports of planned military action as ``nonsense anda fabrication.''
Mladina, the official publication of the Socialist Youthorganization, wrote of possible military intervention in itscurrent issue.
The statement did not identify the foreign elements and saidSlovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such aconspiracy.
Slovenia's Communist Party presidium also ``expresseddisagreement with part of the military council's opinions,'' saidthe statement.
The police said ``they had no available data which would justifysuch evaluations,'' according to the ministry statement.

Introduction:
The focus of the drought plaguing much of thenation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for mostareas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday.
The national picture shows the current drought to be aboutequivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than inseveral years in the 1930s or 1956.
The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot,dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the OhioValley to the Mid-Atlantic states.
At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation wasundergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.
Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the GreatLakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency'sClimate Analysis Center reported.
The drought region now extends well into West Virginia andincludes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky andTennessee, the weather service drought advisory said.
The drought has been accompanied by higher than normaltemperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the westernGreat Lakes region.
Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation,however, the weather service noted.
Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak frontsalong the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scatteredshowers in the extreme northern Plains and upper MississippiValley.

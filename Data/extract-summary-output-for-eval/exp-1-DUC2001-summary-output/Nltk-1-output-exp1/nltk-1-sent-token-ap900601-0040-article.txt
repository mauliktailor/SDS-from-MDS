Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, areill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center.
There are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from Category 1,which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to Category 5,with top winds greater then 155 mph.
Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity arebased on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves andincreased rainfall trends in West Africa, near the breeding watersfor most hurricanes.
``If the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come,we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes,'' said Sheets.
The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo last yeartaught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate andprotect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from Maine toTexas, Sheets said.
Introduction:
The 1990 Atlantic hurricane seasonbegins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East andGulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a newera of destructive storms.
The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by atropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavyrain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into ahurricane.
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportpredicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine toTexas will grow 60 percent, counting from 1960 until 2010.
Also, he said Hugo showed inadequacies in the Emergency BroadcastSystem and some communities used emergency shelters ill-suited towithstand a powerful hurricane.
From 1970 to 1989, there were onlyeight such storms, including Hugo, Sheets said.
``What we're looking at is the possibility of greater destructionand greater loss of life,'' Sheets said Thursday.

Heredity and diet appear to be the major reasons that 14 to21 percent of Hispanics -- and up to 40 percent in the 64 to 75 age group --contract diabetes, said Rochelle McNamara, executive director of the DiabetesSociety of Santa Clara Valley.
Introduction:Hispanics, whose incidence of diabetes is two to three times as high as thepopulation of the United States as a whole, can learn how to manage theillness at a free half-day clinic Saturday at St. Louise Health Center inMorgan Hill.
Also, the high-fat diet of many Hispanics leads to obesity, which seemsto trigger diabetes, McNamara said.
Participants will learn that traditional dishes can be just astasty -- but healthier -- when made with unsaturated fats, and that exercisewill reduce weight, which in turn will lower the possibility of contractingdiabetes.
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The diabetes management program for Hispanicswill be from 9 a.m. to noon at St. Louise Health Center, 18500 St. LouiseDrive, off Cochrane Road in Morgan Hill.
You have to manageyour own diabetes, and we're teaching people how to take care of themselves,"McNamara said.
The programs, which first began in 1984, are aimed at peoplewho speak only Spanish or people who are more comfortable receivinginstruction in that language.

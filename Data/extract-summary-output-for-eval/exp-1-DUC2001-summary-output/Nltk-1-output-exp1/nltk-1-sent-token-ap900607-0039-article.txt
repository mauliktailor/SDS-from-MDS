The president, who leaves office July 28, said the newly formedPeople's Defense Revolutionary Movement, is the ``urban,metropolitan organ of the Shining Path.''
Garcia spoke Wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebelattacks in Lima and a series of weekend raids around the capitalthat resulted in the seizure of five Shining Path safe houses and 31arrests.
Two people were injured in the car bombings near the GovernmentPalace on Tuesday night and Wednesday and Garcia called the upsurgein urban violence a ``desperate response'' to the weekend raids.
The Maoist-inspired Shining Path operates in at least half ofPeru, especially in the mountains and jungle, but has had littlesuccess in expanding to coastal cities.
The Shining Path draws much of its support from indigenouspeoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in thecountry of 22 million of descendants of European immigrants.
The raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed,Garcia said: ``The people who were captured were essential to thenew movement.''
In one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upper-class Limasuburb, police found tons of Shining Path documents and propaganda.

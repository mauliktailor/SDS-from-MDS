"A large concentration of vegetation, heavy fuelloads, lots of wooden structures, ingress-egress (problems), lack of water,they're all there," said Fremont Fire Chief Dan Lydon, whose department wouldbe one of the first called to a fire in Kilkare.

Ed Ekers, chief of the Santa Cruz city fire department,
worriesabout sending his trucks through "a tunnel of fire" if flames were ever tospread across the canopy of trees above Highway 9.Will
there be water?Even if they can reach a blaze, firefighters know there may not be any waterto fight it.
In fact, the danger of an Oakland-like inferno is in almostall of the hills that ring the South Bay, where homes often are surrounded bydense brush or stately trees, the fuel of rapidly spreading wildfires.
"On a good day, trying to maneuver fireapparatus on those roads is tough," said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chieffor the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald LakeHills.
"The tendency is to have bigger firesthat are much more expensive to put out, with much more property loss," saidRoy Pike, a deputy chief in the California Department of Forestry and FireProtection's Santa Rosa office.
"We would face the samesituation," said Sharon Whaley, spokeswoman for the San Jose Water Co., whichserves foothill areas in Los Gatos, Saratoga and Almaden.
It's in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed anordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100acres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammableshake roofs.
And for everycommunity, like Saratoga, that requires fire-retardant roofs, there areothers, like Los Altos Hills, unwilling to suffer even that inconvenience.
""We could have a fire going fromrooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city,if the weather conditions are right," said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.
"Thedanger is in the Saratoga foothills, where Kraule's department has battlednine deliberately set fires since June -- most recently Oct. 19, the same dayOakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire
that a day laterblossomed into the deadly firestorm.
Now, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up atthe hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when andwhere.
"An estimated 25,000 people live inthe communities along Highway 9 between Santa Cruz and Boulder Creek, thecurvy, two-lane road that would be the only way out in the case of a majorfire.
To MikeBalesteri, chief of the forestry department ranger unit in Santa Clara County,the lesson is simple: "It's either bring your own water or find your own waterin our game.
Seven years later, the Los Altos Hills revolt against fire-retardant roofsstill resonates in the mind of Los Altos Fire Chief Dick Landrum, whosedepartment is charged with protecting the area.
But there areexceptions, such as narrow Kilkare Canyon near Sunol, where 200 homes arestrung along a narrow, five-mile dead-end road that empties onto narrow,winding Niles Canyon Road.
"Those are the risks you take when you live in an arealike this," said Dean Lucke, chief of the forestry department's SanMateo-Santa Cruz ranger unit.
The lesson of the Oakland hills, firefighters say, is to contain andextinguish even the smallest fires as quickly as possible.
"And increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreadinginto even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, wherenumerous trees create an "urban forest.
But, often, thatmeans firefighters have to overcome narrow roads, weak bridges, inadequatewater pressure and gridlock from fleeing residents.
"You do this evaluation of what you think you'd be effective at salvaging,"said Don Shaw, a battalion chief for the Palo Alto Fire Department.
Challenge forfirefightersMany of the South Bay's most vulnerable areas -- such asRedwood Estates above Los Gatos and Emerald Lake Hills above Redwood City --began as colonies of summer homes, a handful of secluded cottages strung alongnarrow winding roads.
In the east foothills and southern SantaClara County, homeowners have to provide only 5,000 gallons for firefighting,barely enough for five minutes at the rate some firetrucks pump.
"In general, firefighters say, the heavily wooded Santa CruzMountains are more susceptible to major fires than the grass-covered easternfoothills.
"Combine that with panic, with people getting out of the way, andyou're setting the stage for disaster.

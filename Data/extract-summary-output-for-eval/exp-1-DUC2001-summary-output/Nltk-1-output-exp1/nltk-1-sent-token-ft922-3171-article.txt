The proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of theRepublican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospectiveDemocratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and mostof the Democratic leadership in Congress.
'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if theydon't send a complete package in these three areas, the CongressionalDemocrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn'tmatter,' said Mr Freeman.
Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executivedirector of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as aweapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs toMexico.
But the outpouring of public disaffection for 'politics as usual' has pushedto the forefront of many polls in the US election campaign
Mr Ross Perot,the Texas billionaire.
A centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to theCongress in May 1991, in which he committed himself to action onenvironmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.
Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared itsground well in the House.
'In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator DonRiegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas.
It now has 200 signatories to a resolution,introduced by Congressman Henry Waxman and majority leader Richard Gephardt,which warns that they will not support a Nafta that does not have strongenvironment or food safety provisions.
Between retirements and election defeats,one-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foreseethe prevailing sentiment on trade issues.

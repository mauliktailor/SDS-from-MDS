Astaphan said Johnson was not on stanozolol when he beat Lewis in a world-record time of 9.79 seconds for the 100 meters gold, a medal taken away from him when he then tested positive for stanozolol use by Olympics officials.
Dr. Jamie Astaphan, in a telephone interview from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, said Johnson was depressed last May by a hamstring injury that threatened to end his rivalry against Carl Lewis for the 100 meters Olympics gold medal. "
Introduction:
Ben Johnson's personal physician has said the disgraced Olympic sprinter took a banned steroid on one occasion four months before the Seoul Olympics last year, the Toronto Star newspaper reported today.
Asked how he could be certain, Astaphan replied: "I must admit that even though I am his personal physician, there's no way I can keep a constant check on him. "
Commission counsel Robert Armstrong said it was "totally irresponsible that Dr. Astaphan made such statements outside of the commission and not under oath where they are available to be tested by cross-examination."
But it would not make any sense for an athlete to go back on a drug which a few months previously could have ruined him for life."
"He was immediately brought to me and I nursed him back to top condition," he said.

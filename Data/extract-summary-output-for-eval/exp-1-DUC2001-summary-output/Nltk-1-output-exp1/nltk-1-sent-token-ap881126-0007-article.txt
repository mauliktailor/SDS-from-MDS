Scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocksinsulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, saidPi-Sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutritiondivision at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
``We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be, if not thefinal cause, at least a major part of the disease process,'' saidNew Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper.
The new work is ``a very important finding'' if amylin trulyblocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, F.Xavier Pi-Sunyer, an authority on Type II diabetes, said Friday.
In his presentation, Cooper said the hormone, dubbed ``amylin,''was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreasesof diabetics.
The research ``opens the door to the scientific study of thedisease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially themechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging,'' he said.
Cooper, who has been working with scientists at OxfordUniversity, described the hormone research this week at the 13thInternational Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney, Australia.
Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulinsecretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in TypeII diabetes, he said.

the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for themost common form of the disease, a scientist says.

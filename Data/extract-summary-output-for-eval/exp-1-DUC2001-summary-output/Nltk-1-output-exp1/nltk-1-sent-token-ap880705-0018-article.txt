The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, nearYosemite, was a ``bottle rocket,'' said the forest's spokeswoman,Mary Hale.
``The forecast for the next two or three days is dry, with lowerhumidities and conditions more favorable to burning,'' said Damron.``But this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforcethe lines and complete lines that we don't have yet.''
Crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air,Damron said, as four helicopters and three air tankers droppedchemical retardant and water on the spreading flames.
At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawathaforest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said fromthe national forest's headquarters in Escanaba, Mich.
``We're going to start releasing crews from this fire,''Bluedorn said.

Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity,reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon andhoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning,Hale said.

De la Garza said he hopes the House Interior Committee, which hasjurisdiction over the National Park Service, and the Agriculturesubcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the U.S. ForestService, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, theworst in a century.
``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area,you speak to two
and you get three opinions,'' says Rep. Kika de laGarza, a Texas Democrat.
``I was in Montana and I visited with some people and I have someconcern over some of the practices of the Forest Service,'' de laGarza said in an interview last week.
The mostsevere were in and around Yellowstone and Alaska, although therewere fires in the South, California and the Pacific Northwest.
Introduction:
The chairman of the House Agriculture Committeesays hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Servicehandled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West,including one-third of Yellowstone National Park.
Drought conditions, high winds and a ``tremendous build-up'' oftinder, in Yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988 fires theworst in a hundred years, officials said.
The hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitationof charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summerfires, said a subcommittee staff member.

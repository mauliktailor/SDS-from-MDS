The State Department said in Washington that it had receivedreports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S.involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's secondin command.
Arafat said the document ``reveals the U.S. administration isplanning, in full cooperation with the Israelis, to conduct acrusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the PLO for them.
``It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafatmay have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks againstAmerican citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliationfor last month's assassination of Abu Jihad.
Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, claimedthe threat to kill PLO officials was made in a U.S. governmentdocument the PLO obtained from an Arab government.
``On April 18th (a) State Department spokesman said that theUnited States `condemns this act of political assassination,' `hadno knowledge of' and `was not involved in any way in thisassassination.
It read:   ``You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern andparticulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approvedAbu Jihad's assassination.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United Stateshas been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries aboutpossible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
There have been accusations by the PLO
that the United Statesknew about and approved plans for slaying Wazir.
It appeared tobe part of a longer document with the word ``CONFIDENTIAL'' stampedat the bottom.
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphydenied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLOofficials.
The document, which was typewritten in English, referred toWazir by his code name, Abu Jihad.

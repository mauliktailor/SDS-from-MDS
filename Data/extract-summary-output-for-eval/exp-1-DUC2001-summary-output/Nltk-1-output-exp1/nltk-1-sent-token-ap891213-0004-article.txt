If that seems like a lot, Richard, who grows wheat, soybeans andbarley, notes it costs him $150,000 for rent, interest, seed,fertilizer, equipment and other necessities.
For Larry Richard, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000acres near the town of Horace,
$39,000 in aid, even coupled with$55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to ``just enough to break even.
It was the same in North Dakota, which has struggled with anexodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading smalltowns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade.
A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conductedby The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside theMidwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousandsof farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more seriousthan the normal trials of nature.
Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley,was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance.
The thirdstory in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,''examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmersmost in need.
``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major newwave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Beltproducers,'' said Mark Edelman, a university economist.
Wheat, corn,barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grownhere.
``From '81 through '86, the bottom pretty much fell out ofeverything,'' said Greg Schulz, who farms about five miles fromGrindberg.
Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, thestate still needs ``a good year to get back on our feet,'' Haucksaid.
Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, hesaid, ``I was able to mark time in '88.
In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $530million, Aakre said.
``As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, ``next year'salways the best year.
``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well shortof bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but itprovided a safety net,'' he said.
``We didn't get that in '89,'' he added, referring tocontinuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-centralsections.
What I'm saying is, the farmergot the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.''
Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banksand households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion, the study said.
But for this farmer and others, itwas a give-and-take bailout:
Take the money with one hand, give itaway with the other.
Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to otherdrought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota andWisconsin.
Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mailpart-time, thinks the government last year ``pushed he panic buttonon this disaster thing and went too far.
``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg,another farmer in this Red River Valley county.
North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust
Bowldays with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received themost disaster dollars.
``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' saidDwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist.
``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindbergsaid.
But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid,including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their landand may have prevented some business closures.
Two reasons why: more acres of wheat wereplanted this year, and farmers don't have grain reserves to sell athigh prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.
About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farmsin Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres.
Schulz, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $100,000maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or layoff help.
``You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop isgoing to be,'' he said.
``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and boughtCadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' Grindberg added.
The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 millioninto North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependentstate.
Another university survey of 466 farmers said that withoutdrought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have beenjust $6,300.
1 producer of hard-red spring wheat, losttwo-thirds of its 1988 crop; millions of normally golden acreswithered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps.
``If it hadn't been for drought aid,the economic situation all through North Dakota would have beendisastrous.
Good crops the next two years started to reverse thetrend, but drought stalled the recovery.
Next year,we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.''

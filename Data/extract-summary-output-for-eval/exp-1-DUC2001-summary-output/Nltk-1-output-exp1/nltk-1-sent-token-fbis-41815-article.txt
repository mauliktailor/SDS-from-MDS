It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.
Another danger taken seriously by the zoo, a world centre for breeding rare and endangered species, is that animals bred in captivity could carry the infection when released into the wild.
It is more likely, the scientists believe, that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along, as with more mundane infections.
Sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely.
If, however, it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger.
If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease.
Only one of the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep, believed to be the origin of the outbreak.
The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows.
The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others.
The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Nor can at least three of the affected animals have caught the disease from their mothers, who did not suffer from it.

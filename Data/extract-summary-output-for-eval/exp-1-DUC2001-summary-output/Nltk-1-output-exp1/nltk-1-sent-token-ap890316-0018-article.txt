Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed,it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solareclipse, Edwin Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory in LosAngeles, said in a telephone interview.
``Apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the Sun and thesudden appearance of Mars had to be resolved by an explanationthrough liver divination,'' wrote the researchers from theUniversity of Amsterdam and Leiden University.
In addition, the text apparently indicates that Mars was visibleat the time of the eclipse, the Dutch researchers said.
The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and thestudy assumes that citizens of Ugarit followed an Egyptian-stylecalendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said.
But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutchscientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happenedabout 150 years later, on March 5, 1223
B.C.
They concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tabletmisidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred.
Introduction:
Scientists missed by 150 years in dating theoldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tabletthat also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researcherssaid today.
Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse,recorded on a clay tablet found in Syria, occurred on May 3, 1375B.C.

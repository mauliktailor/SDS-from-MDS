Francis, testifying in 1988 in Torontoat a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports,seemed a mad scientist, something on the order of Dr. Frankenstein.

BooksBamberger is a Philadelphia Inquirer sportswriter.
And although he spoke of his athletes as if theywere family members, too, he made it plain, under oath, that he had given themevery steroid combination imaginable, his experiments all carefullycalibrated, charted and analyzed.
24, 1988,
Francis' most famous pupil, Ben Johnson, who immigrated toToronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 14-year-old, ran 100 meters in 9.79 secondsat the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
He argues,essentially, that to be a world-class sprinter, you must use steroids -- hemakes this argument even as Johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 OlympicGames in Barcelona, Spain, without them.
Francis,the Canadian national sprint coach, knew the polysyllabic names and complexcharacteristics of steroids -- furazabol, stanozolol, Dianabol -- as if theywere members of his family.
And because of that testimony, we have "Speed Trap,"an elaboration of what Francis said at the inquiry and a history of hisremarkable path through the world of track and field.
)At the end of "Speed Trap,"Francis says that steroids cannot be simply banned -- their use is tooprevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well.
About42 hours after my life's greatest moment," Francis writes on the first page ofhis confessional, "Speed Trap," his "nightmare began.
Francis, without naming names, convinces us that steroid usage isrampant, but he tells us what that means to him only in a technical sense.
Welearn that if athletes take steroids on their own, independent of an official(but still illicit, of course) program, it's called "free-lancing."
By encouraginghis athletes to use steroids -- and Francis maintains that they all wanted todo so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up --Francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field.
The time was a world record and gaveJohnson the gold medal, ahead of the defending champion, U.S. star CarlLewis.
Francis offers theories for the positive test result -- free-lancing,sabotage, a screw-up by the team doctor -- but there is no clear answer.
The early word is that he is stillextremely fast, probably one of the fastest men in the world -- but no longerthe fastest.
Steroids do not make a runner runfaster, Francis explains, but they enable a runner to train harder.
But I was a sprint coach, and I had a different job,"he concludes.
"We ceased being natural ages ago, the moment westopped running barefoot on dirt paths," Francis writes.
We learn that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is nothing new in theworld of sports -- that cocaine and arsenic and codeine were used by athletesin the 1896 Olympic Games.
But, Francis says, thereis no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught.
"Johnson, theworld's fastest man, had tested positive for illegal steroid use.
His gold medal was revoked, and his world record was, too.
But the Francis system, like all systems, was not foolproof. "
"It is a formidablechallenge to distinguish between nature and artifice, a task I would leave tothe philosophers.
The desirefor speed comes with incredible costs, and they are the trap.
Francis would have us believe that without steroids, Johnsoncannot be the fastest.
What did he really feel toward Johnson?After a two-year ban, Johnsonis running again without Francis' coaching.
For all its candor, answers and revelations are not forthcoming in "SpeedTrap."
Because they held an inquiry,Francis had to testify.
Because Johnson was caught, the Canadians were embarrassed.
Because they wereembarrassed, they conducted a federal inquiry.
We learn that Johnson harmed his own world-recordtimes by raising his hand jubilantly as he approached the finish line.
"But "Speed Trap" left me wishing Francis had at leasttried his hand at philosophy.
After all, he had neverbeen caught before.
"They ran fast, all right.
Thedangers have been exaggerated, Francis says.
"To help a few gifted people run as fast as they could.
People who want running to be a"natural" sport are naive.
That's oneof Francis' theories for why Johnson got caught.
No one of Johnson's standing had been caught before.
Suddenly hewas the world's fastest cheat.
Thebook lacks a strong sense of character development.
Millions of dollars worth of endorsementsshriveled up.
To ask whywe do the things we do? "
It does not take any moralstand; it lacks passion.
His system had worked remarkably.

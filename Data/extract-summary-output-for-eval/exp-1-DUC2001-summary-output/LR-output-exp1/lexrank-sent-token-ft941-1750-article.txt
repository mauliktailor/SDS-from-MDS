Claiming that a more competitive Mexico, with free access to the US andCanada, will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developedunder current trade agreements, the region has asked for 'parity' withMexico in exporting to Nafta signatories.
Some regional government officials and US legislators supportive of theCaribbean's concerns - which include the possible diversion of investmentsto Mexico - have now concluded that what would amount to a de factoextension of Nafta is unlikely.
The measures to be announced by the US are a result of discussions last yearbetween President Bill Clinton and leaders from the Caribbean and CentralAmerica.
Mr Clinton and his Mexican counterpart, Mr Carlos Salinas, assuredthe Caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected bythe implementation of Nafta, and that efforts would be made to protect theirmarkets in the US and Canada.
'President Clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefitsof Nafta are felt by the Caribbean countries,' said Mr Manuel Esquivel,prime minister of Belize. '
Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of the CaribbeanCommunity (Caricom), said he expected parity to be given to 'only a few' ofthe region's exports, including textiles.
'In presenting their case for parity, Caribbean leaders have argued that theUS and Canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economicdislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to Mexico.
'Each Dollars 1bn of US exports to the region creates 20,000 new jobs in theUS,' he said. '
'Without improved access to the US and Canadian markets to counter Mexico'sbenefits under Nafta, the Caribbean basin countries will have to continuedepending on their current trade preference agreements with the US andCanada.
'The Nafta playing field will never be level for the region,' he said.
'Nobody is going to give us an even playing field, but we have to work tomake it less uneven.

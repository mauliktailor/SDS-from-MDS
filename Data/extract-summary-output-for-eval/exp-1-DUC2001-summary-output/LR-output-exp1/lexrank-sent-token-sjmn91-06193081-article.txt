From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people sawthe moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible.
InHawaii, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years, stunning scientistsby releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse.

In the160-mile-wide swath from Hawaii to Baja to Mexico to Brazil, the morningturned into night -- the only region where the eclipse made the Earth totallydark.
At the astronomy observatoryat the top of 13,800-foot Mauna Kea, high cirrus clouds thwarted three of the10 scientific experiments.
"I came especially for this, and hope we get to seeit," said Margaret MacLeod, a mathematics and science teacher from ManhattanBeach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii.
"If we don't get to see it, I mayhave to go to Iraq for the next one.

Introduction: Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesdaythat national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic goldmedal for using drugs to enhance his performance.
``I don't believe he did it onpurpose.
He hasn't got the guile to do that.''
Canada's sole gold medal went to American Carl Lewis, who finishedsecond in the 100-meter dash.
``It puts a dent in Canada,'' said Scott Shaw, a 10th gradestudent in Calgary, Alberta, said Tuesday.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who had thanked the Jamaican-bornrunner for the ``thrill of a lifetime'' after his record-breaking9.79-second performance Saturday, called the drug scandal ``amoment of great sorrow for all Canadians.''
But Johnson's family was left confused and outraged by the turnof events.
``My brother is not guilty,'' a distaught Rodney told reportersin her yard in the Toronto suburb of Rexdale.
``If you could cuthim into a million pieces and test him over again _ my brother isnot on drugs.''
Outside the townhouse, police were called in to control thecrowd and the traffic.
Ben!
Ben!''
In August, fans were outraged when hockey legend WayneGretzky, another national hero, was traded from the Edmonton Oilersto the Los Angeles Kings.
Mike Sokowski, a teammate at the 1984 Olympic Games in LosAngeles, said: ``Ben's a pretty simple guy.
Ben does not do drugs.
Canadian speedskater Gaetan Boucher judged the sprinter harshly,saying he has ``no respect'' for an athlete who takes drugs.
``From time to time people would come to me in a private way _ and this happened one or two times ... that maybe Ben Johnson isusing steroids or other drugs,'' he said.
Johnson was last tested in Canada in February at a Montreallaboratory.
Charest said he didn't press Johnson to have a drug test becausehe thought the sprinter was aware that medal winners at theOlympics would be tested for drugs immediately followingcompetition.

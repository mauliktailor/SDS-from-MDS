Introduction: In Valdez, Alaska, the Coast Guard confirmed Saturday that a fresh oil sheen has seeped from the ruptured Exxon Valdez and that a complete cleanup of the damaged tanker is impossible.
Later in the day in Juneau, a package of bills aimed at protecting Alaska from another devastating oil spill like the one that fouled Prince William Sound was passed by the state Senate with little trouble.
"Oil is clinging to the tanks inside," said Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the federal on-the-scene coordinator.
Unfortunately, it's impossible to completely remove the oil unless you steam-clean the tanker, and nobody intends to do that," Robbins said.
Robbins did not give an estimate of how widespread the oil sheen, or shininess on the water's surface, had become.
"Obviously, this (ship) is a hot potato.
We may end up going to a foreign port."
Reacting to the largest oil spill in the nation's history, the Republican-led Senate acted with unusual speed to move the six bills through the chamber and to the House.
However, it appeared unlikely that the Democrat-controlled House would approve the entire package before adjournment, which is scheduled for May 9.
11-Million-Gallon Spill The Senate action came five weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef, spewing more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into the fish- and wildlife-rich sound.
Exxon reported Saturday that it has paid out $500,000 to 150 fishermen on claims of lost work.

The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot,dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the OhioValley to the Mid-Atlantic states.
Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the GreatLakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency'sClimate Analysis Center reported.
In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of thenorthern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.
A 30-day weather forecast issued Wednesday held little hope forimprovement.
And a separate climate assessment added that manyareas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percentchance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
On the otherhand, western portions of the Mississippi Valley have received somerelief due to recent rains.
The national picture shows the current drought to be aboutequivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than inseveral years in the 1930s or 1956.
Recent rains have resulted in local flooding in Texas, butnationally streamflows are below normal, and even in Texas areexpected to fall back to below average levels.
Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation,however, the weather service noted.
In addition to Thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-rangeoutlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remainhotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lowerMidwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies andGreat Basin.
Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward fromTexas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.

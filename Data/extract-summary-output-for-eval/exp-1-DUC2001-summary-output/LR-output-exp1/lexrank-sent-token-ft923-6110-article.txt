Introduction: DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it wasestimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this centurythreatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.
Government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advisedor ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.
The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causingbillions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterdaywas moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140miles an hour.
However, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early toassess the costs accurately.
In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some10-15 miles south of Miami.
The town of Homestead, near the centre of thestorm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base.
The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the USindustry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State FarmGroup and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck.
These are also theleading property/casualty and home insurance groups in Louisiana, togetherwith American International Group.
A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company hadroughly 20 per cent of the Florida market.
Its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and itsreserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary.
Travellers said it had flown 50 claimsadjusters in to Florida late on Monday and was assessing losses.
About 12per cent of Travellers' home insurance premium income came from Florida lastyear, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums.
The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989,cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of thetotal damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn.

William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at ColoradoState University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantichurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but aboveaverage for the decade.
The hurricane season officially begins June 1, and its mostactive period usually begins Aug. 1.
Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annualhurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his firstformal 1988 forecast in late May.
``It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which doesform in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the averagehurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season,''Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.
Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterlywinds at the equator and the approaching end of ``El Nino'' period.
Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actuallyoccurred.
In 1984, when therewere five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven.
He said the droughthas robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start theirescalation into hurricanes.
Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conferencestressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during thelull in hurricanes; a surge in storms, up to the levels of the1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.

Introduction: On May 6 the Queen and President Mitterrand will declare the Channel Tunnelopen.
At the moment, agents report more inquiries, but the markets in bothcountries are still quiet and prices low, especially in France.
Le Shuttle's high starting prices for a vehicle and its passengers willeventually come down creating price competition between rail, ferry,catamaran and Hovercraft.
Far-sighted prospective buyers looking near Calais include hauliers wantingto set up a base on the Continent, and Asian entrepreneurs who see anadvantage in being close to Belgium.
'The British are mainly looking for houses, rather than apartments, althoughFrench and Dutch buyers are also in the market.
Inquiries about northernFrench property picked up just before Christmas, says Maggie Kelly, ofFrench agents L'Abri-tanique in Hesdin.
UK buyers can now sell their UK home to put money into a mainresidence or second home in France.
Prices have stopped falling in northernFrance and hopes are high that the tunnel, motorways and new railways willresuscitate the region.
Britons who bought in 1989 or 1990 may find it a good time to sell, if theydid not pay too much at the time and have renovated their properties since.
But some paid far too much.
For example, a glorious, repossessedabbey with five acres in Tortefontaine, with a 12th century hall and manyoutbuildings, is on sale at around FFr750,000 (Pounds 86,000) from agentsLatitudes or L'Abri-tanique.
A house inHesdin, or a nearby country cottage, make good weekend retreats and are farcheaper than their English equivalents.
A small house in Montreuil, a walled town with cobbled streets, costsFFr280,000 from La Residence.
A small, partly-restored farmhouse nearMontreuil can be bought for FFr135,000 from A House in France.
Thirtyminutes' drive from Boulogne, a long, low, Norman-style, half-timbered,farmhouse is for sale at FFr515,250, and 50 minutes away another costsFFr436,800 (reduced from FFr650,000).Near St Omer agent Cote d'Opale is selling an 18th century chateau withwings added in 1908 for FFr4.46m.
Latitudes has on its books an 18th century town house with internalcourtyard for FFr1.3m, a snip when you think what you would pay in Paris.
Penny Zoldan, ofLatitudes, has a flat in Le Touquet and sees it as a good base forforeigners.
Nearby, at Hardelot, there are plenty of building plots for sale beside thetwo golf courses (consult Latitudes).
In the countryside beyond Dieppe, a typical Norman house, restored andincluding most of the furniture and a cottage, is for sale for Pounds125,000 from Domus Abroad.
Towards Paris, off the autoroute from Calais, Philip Hawkes is selling the18th century Chateau de Pronleroy for FFr13m.

Buyers don't see that yet.
'Once the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the areaand people will move in.
An apartment in The Grand at Folkestone, the former hotel, is for sale fromCluttons for Pounds 89,500.

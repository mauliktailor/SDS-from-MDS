Police could only look on, outnumbered, as crowdslooted shops, and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack.
The controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday, thefirst night of rioting, against sending in National Guard troops, and onlyto have bowed later to evidence that his police force was incapable ofhandling the violence.
That the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by theriots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on Mr Gates'sreputation.
In his 14 years of office, his critics say he has built a heavilypoliticised force in his own image: aggressive, insensitive and widelytinged with racism.
President George Bush last year called Mr Gates 'an exemplary police chief,'although at the time he called the conduct of the four Los Angeles officers -whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggeredthis week's protests and violence - 'sickening' and 'outrageous'.A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under thechairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretaryof state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, interms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates theofficer from the community'.Besides recommending that Mr Gates should go, the Christopher commissionurged a policy of community policing with more foot patrols, as well asmeasures to discipline racist police officers and to improve theinvestigation of complaints about police brutality.
The commission found that a significant minority of the Los Angeles policeforce 'repetitively misuse force' without being properly disciplined.
Six months after its initial report, however, the commission noted that ofthe 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutalitycomplaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from fieldduty.

Introduction:SLOVENIA'S economic prospects would improve significantly if it could settleits relations with the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), or centralbank, establish new relations with foreign creditors as rapidly as possible,and join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Before Slovenia declaredindependence, any foreign exchange deposits which Slovene citizens depositedin banks in Slovenia were transferred to the NBY.
These deposits amount toDollars 1.2bn.
Officials at the theLjubljanska Bank, Slovenia's largest bank into which the majority of theforeign exchange accounts were originally deposited, are hoping that the thegovernment of Slovenia will guarantee these debts and open up negotiationswith the NBY for the eventual return of the deposits.
Mr Marko Kranjec, vice-governor of the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank,reckons Slovenes will have to wait years before they can obtain theirforeign exchange savings.
Slovene officials arealso anxious to start negotiations on the unallocated Yugoslav federal debt.
The federal debt totals Dollars 14.6bn.
Of this amount, Slovenia acceptsthat its allocated share of that debt is Dollars 1.8bn. '
Mr Jose Mencinger, a member of the board of Slovenia's central bank, saidservicing that debt should not be a problem. '
That is a decline of only 5 per cent compared to theyear before.
So, we are not in such a bad position with regard to servicingthe debt,' he said.
Slovene officials say they are committed to repaying its share of theunallocated federal debt.
'This is going to take a long time to settle,' said Mr Kranjec.

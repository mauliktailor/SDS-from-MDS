Introduction: The stripping of Ben Johnson's Olympic gold medalin a drug scandal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed a nationhungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky.
The euphoria was dashed when Johnson tested positivefor stanzolol, a muscle-building steroid outlawed by Olympicofficials.
Dr. George Astaphan, Johnson's personal physician, and LarryHeidebrecht, Johnson's agent, insisted the sprinter had not takenstanzolol.
``The only thing we can say is that it is a tragedy, a mistakeor sabotage,'' Heidebrecht said.
He returned home with a jacket over his head, hurdling a hedgeto duck reporters after flying home from New York in the seclusionof a jet cockpit.
It was unheroic conduct for the world's fastest human, who hadbeen awarded the Order of Canada and a medal from Queen Elizabethat the Commonwealth Games.
``We're feeling low.
Some of us don't want to accept whathappened,'' said John Furedy, a psychologist at the University ofToronto, in assessing the mational psyche.
The drug scandal brought the same sickening feeling to thenation as did Gretzky's trade to the Los Angeles Kings.
``There was enormous exhilaration.
Then 72 hours later, therewas this roller coaster ride to the bottom,'' Frayne said.
Canadian youth took the news hard.
``We look up to the guy.
``He's letting all his fans down.
Canada has always tried to escape the influence of the UnitedStates, where its dollar is worth 80 cents.
Now it has forfeitedits only gold medal of the Olympics.
``He tarnished the name and reputation of Canada and let itspeople down,'' said the Fredickton Gleaner.
But columnist Gary Lautens of the Toronto Star said the nationshould not cover its head in shame.
It's cheating.
It's believing theend justifies the means, it's looking for an unfair edge,'' Lautenssaid.

Introduction: The Agriculture Department says it has been ontop of the drought since March 1, monitoring the situation, settingup hotlines to handle worried callers and issuing enough statementsto paper a thousand bird cages, easy.
One of the latest informational gimmicks is a ``USDABackgrounder'' listing the department's ``drought-related actions''since the blotter-like furnaces began roaring across most of thenation.
``It was my idea, my memory isn't what it used to be,'' quippedSally Michael, the department's deputy director of information.``This helps me keep track of what we've done.''
Only twoitems had dollar amounts.
One involved meat purchases for schoolcafeterias and the other a credit deal for the sale of meat toMexico.
The backgrounders will be updated every two weeks.
Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng establishesUSDA Drought Task Force under the chairmanship of Deputy SecretaryPeter C. Myers.

Introduction: Cheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and French workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through and shake hands. "
Today, for the first time, men can cross the channel underground," French President Francois Mitterrand said.
Using jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, 37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the British and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a "chunnel."
The smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national flags.
God save the queen!"
cried French workers, uncorking Champagne bottles. "
Vive la France!"
came the reply from the British side.
The $16.7-billion Channel Tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to London by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in June, 1993.
But experts say the charges may be at least double the 1986 projections of $46 per person in a car and $19 per train passenger.
The British tunnelers actually linked up with the French on Oct. 29, when workers drilled a 2-inch hole through the chalk in a service tunnel.
Bonjour," boomed Fagg. "
Fagg and Rifkind rode on to Sangatte, while Cozette and Delebarre headed for Folkestone to join in celebrations that lasted into the night.
Nine workers have been killed during the project.
The cost has climbed from an initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion.
But Britain has shown worry over the loss of its historic moat from the Continent.

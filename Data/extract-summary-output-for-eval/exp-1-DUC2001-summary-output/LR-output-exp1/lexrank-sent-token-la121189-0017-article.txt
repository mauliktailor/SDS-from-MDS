Not until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez, 29, cross the U.S./Mexican border to register for, then reach the starting line of, the San Diego International Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive.
Two hours, 16 minutes and 12 seconds later, in only his second marathon -- his first was this event last year when he finished eighth -- Beatriz Martinez crossed the finish line 39 seconds ahead of South African Mark Plaatjes, now of Lake Forest, Ill. "I wasn't 100% sure I'd win," he said through an interpreter, "but I had much confidence that I'd do well.
It was the first marathon Rollins has completed this year, after dropping out of the New York City Marathon four weeks ago in mile 18 because of stomach cramps.
"I went out real conservative, I ran my own race and it paid off."
Beatriz Martinez and Rollins received $5,000 each for their victories.
And for Beatriz Martinez, who ran cross country for San Diego City College in 1988, he might as well have won the lottery.
"I want to help my family and friends who raised the money for me," said Beatriz Martinez, a school teacher in Mexico City.
Plaatjes and Ireland took home $2,500 each, and Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06) of Naucalpan, Mexico, the men's third place finisher, and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20), now of New York City, third in the women's race, received $1,500.
Doug Kurtis of Detroit was successful in his bid to run his 12th marathon in a calendar year under 2 hours, 20 minutes.
According to Dr. Bill Burke, co-owner of the marathon, Castillo was told several times that he was running the marathon course, but he decided to continue.
"I traveled too much to get here to go home and say I went the wrong way," Castillo said, also using an interpreter.
But Plaatjes said it was because he and Casillas, who eventually dropped out at mile 18, were so far ahead of the lead pack of Plaatjes, Danny Bustos, Dick LeDoux, Kurtis and Leodigard Martin. "
Said Burke: "My position is that he paid the same fee, he ran the same race and he finished the race."
Although the city didn't allow any vehicles on the course from miles 18-22, Burke said cameras would verify that he did cover the complete distance.
But Beatriz Martinez took the lead at 23 miles and Plaatjes couldn't close the gap.
Rollins and Ireland ran together for 11 miles until Kathy Smith of Irvine took the lead for miles 12-17.

Introduction: IN California, labour leaders, environmentalists and the 'Perotistas'supporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement.
The site of the signing ceremony inSacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, Mr Bob Matsui, one ofthe leading proponents of Nafta in the US House of Representatives.
These featuredthe potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomesa reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the US.Anti-Nafta crusaders drove caravans through Tennessee, California and Texasto mobilise opposition.
Equipped as information centres, the vans cruisedfrom town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradationin Mexico.
With just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds134,230) a year in cash - foes of Nafta have worked for three years to mounta massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public.
However, 63 per cent believe Nafta will costUS jobs.
Although the Clinton administration weeks ago said it would appoint a 'Naftaczar' to shepherd the pact through Congress, it has yet to announce it hasfound anyone to take on the task.
By contrast, the opposition has an'anti-Nafta czar' in place and making speeches around the country.
Forty-one states have been organised, and every twoweeks the organisers hold long conference calls to plot strategies.
One California gubernatorial hopeful,Ms Kathleen Brown - sister of former Governor Jerry Brown - has been stalkedby demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.
According to Mr Craig Merrilees, director of California's Fair TradeCampaign, Ms Brown has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the restof the state's Democratic establishment.

Introduction:   Dealing with his first major hurricaneas director of the National Hurricane Center , Bob Sheets wasn'tskipping a beat Tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questionsat him.
His schedule of interviews was timed to the minute.
After all, he noted, ``I've flown into 200 hurricanes ... Ireally don't think this is difficult.''
The transition from former Director Neil Frank, widely known forhis distinctive style and flattop haircut, to Sheets, his darkblond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with agray wool-blend jacket, has been a smooth one.
``He knows his job very well and he's a calm personality,''Vivian Jorge, the center's budget analyst, said of Sheets.
And interest in Gilbert has been high since it started packinghurricane-force winds over the weekend and by Tuesday afternoonbecame a Category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a centralpressure of 26.66 inches.
A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strengthhas winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure less than 27.17 inchesand has the potential for causing catastrophic damage.
Gilbert was being compared to the hurricane of 1935, whichslammed into the Florida Keys and killed 600 people, and HurricaneCamille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing256.
Those are the only Category 5 storms which have made landfallthis century.
The major television networks, local stations and newspapersmedia were on hand to monitor the hurricane, which could reach theGulf of Mexico by Thursday, said Sheets.
From there, it's anybody'sguess where it will go, he said.
``It's a brand new ball game as far as the continental UnitedStates is concerned,'' said Sheets.

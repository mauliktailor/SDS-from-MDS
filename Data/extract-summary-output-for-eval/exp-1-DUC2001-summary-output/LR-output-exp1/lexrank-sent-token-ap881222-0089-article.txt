Introduction: Here, at a glance, are developments today involving the crash ofPan American World Airways Flight 103 Wednesday night in Lockerbie,Scotland, that killed all 259 people aboard and more than 20 peopleon the ground: The jumbo jet, a Boeing 747, apparently exploded in the airbefore crashing and investigators focused on terrorist threats toplace a bomb on a Pan Am airliner.
The crash occurred 54 minutes after takeoff from London'sHeathrow Airport following a routine climb to a cruising altitude of31,000 feet.
The only possible cause immediately ruled out was acollision with another aircraft.
Searchers recovered both the airplane's flight recorders.
Scottish Secretary Malcom Rifkind, the chief British official atthe site, said the widespread wreckage indicated ``the aircraftclearly experienced some form of explosion.''
The wreckage of the 747 scattered bodies and debris over 10 milesof countryside and ravaged the village of Lockerbie.
Forty houses were destroyed whenthe plane crashed.
David Kyd, chief public relations officer, said ``it would seemto us that the most likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard,'' andthat structural problems were unlikely to have been involved in thecrash because of the sudden loss of contact with the plane.
The 747has a reputation for ruggedness and is able to stay aloft even withserious damage to the structure.
An anonymous caller to the AP office in London claimedresponsibility for the crash and said it was in retaliation for thedowning of an Iran Air Airbus by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes inJuly.
We are very proud,'' the male caller said, then hung up quickly.
A senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization saidit was ``nonsensical'' to link Palestinians to the crash.
``It cannot possibly occur to the Palestinians or the Arabs tocommit such an act,'' Mahmoud Abbas, code-named Abu-Mazen, toldreporters when asked about reports that the plane may have beendowned by sabotage.

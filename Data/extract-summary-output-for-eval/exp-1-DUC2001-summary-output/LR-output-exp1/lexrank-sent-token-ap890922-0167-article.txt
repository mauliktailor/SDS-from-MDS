Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.   ``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions andforecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in thosemodels,'' said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, butforecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time forevacuation.
The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting theintensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricanejust hours before it slammed into Charleston.
``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said.``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.''
``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say ourforecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said.
In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites toobtain a global weather picture.
Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at theNational Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information tothe hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes toaccount for current weather conditions and the position of thehurricane.
Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
``We have to remember that those models used are only guidanceproducts,'' Pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.

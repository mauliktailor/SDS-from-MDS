Introduction: A 1987 state constitutional amendmentbroadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felonsmay own guns, a judge ruled.
Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Stephen L. Perkins onFriday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felonagainst Edward Brown of Cumberland.
Prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did notintend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing inthe amendment indicated such an intent.
``Maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the mostbroad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar stateamendments,'' he wrote.
Attorney General James E. Tierney said Saturday that the casewould be appealed, adding, ``With all due respect to JusticePerkins, we think he is wrong.''
The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep andbear arms ``for the common defense.''
Brown had been accused of criminal threatening in 1988, as wellas with illegal possession of a gun.

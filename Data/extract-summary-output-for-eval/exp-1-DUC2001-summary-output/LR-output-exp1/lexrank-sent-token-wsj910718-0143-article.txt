Introduction:L. Gordon Crovitz quotes Alexander Hamilton in "LawmakersSue for Their Jobs -- Another Reason for Term Limits" (Ruleof Law, June 19) to note that legislators sometimes takethemselves too seriously.
But is it true, as Mr. Crovitzimplies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms?Clearly not.
In fact, such limits keptMadison out of legislative service at a critical time in thenation's history.
For that reason and others, the Constitutional Conventionunanimously rejected term limits and the First Congresssoundly defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals.
It was not the Federalists but their adversaries whoclamored for term limits, perhaps because they were then outof power.
To dictate andcontrol them, to tell them who they shall not elect, is toabridge their natural rights."T.K.

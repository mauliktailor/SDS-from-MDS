Introduction:   Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across theopen Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that hasforecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possiblelandfall.
There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead ormissing in a town in Colombia the day before.
``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist atthe National Hurricane Center.
``You just don't see many hurricanesthat take this course and hug the coast.''
The hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and wasexpected to continue that motion through today.
Joan, the Atlantic season's fifth hurricane, is expected tobring 4 to 8 inches of rain along its path.
As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, Joan slowly built itsstrength as it skimmed Colombia's coast, baffling forecasters whohad predicted it to weaken.
Gross said a strong high-pressure system over the northernCaribbean is keeping Joan on its course.
Normally, prevailing windsand upper-level atmospheric conditions push tropical stormsnorthward as they move from the Atlantic, said Gross.
The six-month hurricane season ends Nov. 30.

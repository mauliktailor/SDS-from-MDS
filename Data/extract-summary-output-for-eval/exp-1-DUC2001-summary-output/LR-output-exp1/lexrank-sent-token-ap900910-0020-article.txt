But the 1988 drought wasn't as bad as it might have been,according to an Agriculture Department analysis.
For those who eked out someproduction, or had grain stored from previous years, it wasn't toobad.
The latest postmortem of the 1988 drought's effects was writtenby Gerald W. Whittaker of the department's Economic ResearchService.
All of the information used in the study was from USDA's annualFarm Costs and Returns Survey, which includes detailed income andexpense information derived from personal interviews of farmoperators.
Basic findings:   _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to anaverage of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987.
Income innon-drought areas rose to $62,822 in 1988 from $50,967 in 1987.
_ Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued toimprove their solvency position in 1988.
Thenine states studied as the ``drought region'' were Illinois,Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, SouthDakota and Wisconsin.
In the category of net farm income, the report said the share offarms in a ``favorable financial position'' in 1988 held fairlysteady at 68 percent in the non-drought region, compared with 69.1percent in 1987.
In the drought states, 62.2 percent of the farms were said to bein favorable financial position, compared with 62.8 percent in 1987.
``Even with lower incomes, farmers in the drought regioncontinued to improve their debt position (in relation to assets),''the report said.
The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce thedirect payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA's commodity programs.
Nationally, those payments dropped to $9.8 billion from $11.5billion in 1987.
The nine states in the studycollected about $2.57 billion, or two-thirds of the total.
``This tick, which carries bovine babesiosis _ a serious cattledisease often called Texas cattle fever _ was eradicated from theUnited States in 1943,'' said James W. Glosser, administrator ofthe department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
Strict measures are being taken to prevent the reintroduction ofthe tick, he said.
For example, animal carcasses with hides attached are noteligible for importation into the United States.
Glosser said raw and untreated hides and antlers may qualify ifthey are certified by the Mexican government to have been treatedfor ticks.
Alternately, they may be dipped at one of severalMexican cattle export facilities along the border.
The Agriculture Department is using tiny wheatfields of one square foot each to monitor the spread of leaf andstem rust in the Southeast.
That was a drought year inthe region, and so was 1987.
Then in 1988, some of the wheat plotson low ground near the Gulf Coast drowned out.
Highway maintenance crews sometimes mow down the wheat, alongwith the weeds, Roberts said.

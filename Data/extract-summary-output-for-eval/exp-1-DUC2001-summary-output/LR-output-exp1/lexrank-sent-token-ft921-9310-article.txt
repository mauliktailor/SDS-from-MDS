Introduction:THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiformencephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelopepopulation, the government has admitted.
Three elands, three greater kudu and an arabian oryx have been diagnosedwith the disease over the past three years.
In all, six species other thancattle have been confirmed with the condition during this period.
The statistics - released in response to a written question from Mr RonDavies, a Labour agriculture spokesman - show a disconcertingly rapidincrease in the number of sheep found to have the disease.

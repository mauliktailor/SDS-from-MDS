Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, claimedthe threat to kill PLO officials was made in a U.S. governmentdocument the PLO obtained from an Arab government.
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphydenied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLOofficials.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United Stateshas been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries aboutpossible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
He added that Arafat's interpretation of those contacts was``entirely without foundation.''
Arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villain Baghdad, where extra security guards have been deployed.
He produced a photocopy of the alleged document.
The document, which was typewritten in English, referred toWazir by his code name, Abu Jihad.
``On April 18th (a) State Department spokesman said that theUnited States `condemns this act of political assassination,' `hadno knowledge of' and `was not involved in any way in thisassassination.
``It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafatmay have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks againstAmerican citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliationfor last month's assassination of Abu Jihad.
``Any possible targeting of American personnel and facilities inretaliation for Abu Jihad's assassination would be totallyreprehensible and unjustified.
Arafat said the document ``reveals the U.S. administration isplanning, in full cooperation with the Israelis, to conduct acrusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the PLO for them.
He strongly denied that the PLO planned any such attacks.

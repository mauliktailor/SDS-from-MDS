"The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s," says meteorologist William M. Gray of Colorado State University, who analyzes hurricane patterns.
Hurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No.
In the drier 17-year period of 1970 to 1987, there were only 13 severe storms.
and an atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches).
Officially a 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it "may be a borderline 5," says meteorologist Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars.
Outside the Atlantic area and the eastern Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones.
5 hurricanes have struck the United States with full force, the 1935 Labor Day storm that ravaged the Florida Keys and 1969's Camille, which slammed ashore at Mississippi and Louisiana.
In 1980, Allen, the mightiest Caribbean storm then recorded, had lost much of its punch before it hit the Gulf Coast of Texas. "
If the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions, there is a good probability of the return of stronger storms," Gray said.
But in the 1990s, he warns, U.S. destruction will be at least four to five times more costly than in the '50s and '60s, because of the boom in population and property development along coastal areas.
Hurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea.
They get their power from the water's warmth.
To develop, they need tropical ocean-surface temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. "
If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will," Emanuel explains.

Introduction: President Reagan warned Saturdaythat he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him thatdoes not contain a work requirement.
``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president saidin a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20miles north of here.
Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of hisadministration's economic record, saying Friday's unemploymentfigures showed that the jobless rate ``hovered just above thelowest it's been in 14 years.''
``Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposedwidespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good oldcommon sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work,'' thepresident said.
``I will notaccept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making peopleindependent of welfare.''
A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it aSenate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and aHouse-approved measure that does not.
``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,''the president said.
Downey said that while more people than ever before are working,``the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better offtoday than he or she was 10 years ago; in fact things have gottenworse.''
``Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary,but those requirements should be controlled by state and localofficials who administer our welfare programs, not federalbureaucrats,'' Downey said.

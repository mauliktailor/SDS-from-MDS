``We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be, if not thefinal cause, at least a major part of the disease process,'' saidNew Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper.
The research ``opens the door to the scientific study of thedisease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially themechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging,'' he said.
In his presentation, Cooper said the hormone, dubbed ``amylin,''was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreasesof diabetics.
Complications can include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrenethat requires amputations.
It often can be controlled through diet and exercise.
Cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that blockamylin's secretion or action, opening the possibility of treatment.
The new work is ``a very important finding'' if amylin trulyblocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, F.Xavier Pi-Sunyer, an authority on Type II diabetes, said Friday.
Scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocksinsulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, saidPi-Sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutritiondivision at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.

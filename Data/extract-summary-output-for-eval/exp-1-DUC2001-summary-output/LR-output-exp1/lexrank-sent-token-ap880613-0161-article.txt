Introduction: Police captured the top military leader of theShining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla warhas taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.
Officials said the capture of Osman Morote, 43, considered themost radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to datefor the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in theAndean highlands in May 1980.
``Osman Morote is considered the No.
2 of the party and itsmilitary chief,'' the independent magazine Si said recently.
``Forsome Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, thetrue leader of the organization.''
Abimael Guzman, a former professor of philosophy, founded theShining Path movement and is generally recognized as its leader.
The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow Peru's electedgovernment and install a peasant and worker state patterned afterthe ideas of Mao Tse-tung.
Deputy Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said Morote wasarrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along withtwo women.
Counterinsurgency sources said police raided the house afterneighbors told them of suspicious behavior by the people livingthere.
Palacios said police had suspected Morote was in the house.
The colonel said Morote arrived in Lima a week ago from thenorthern highlands to coordinate terrorists attacks in the capital.
Palacios said the attacks were planned this week to mark the secondanniversary of prison riots in which security forces killed morethan 250 rebel inmates.
There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalrybetween Morote and Guzman, and Mantilla said he did not discountthe possibility that Guzman betrayed Morote to get him out of theway.
Guzman has not been seen for years and rumors have circulatedthat he may have died.

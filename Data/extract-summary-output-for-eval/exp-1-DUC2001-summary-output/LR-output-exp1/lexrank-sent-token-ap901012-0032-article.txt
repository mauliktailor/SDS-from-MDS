The Air Force ``has not changed anything'' in flight operationsas a result of the suspension of flights, Capt.
He said Air Force officials wanted to ``examine potentialhazards and to be sure they were doing everything possible toprevent accidents.
``They have not identified any common cause or commoncontributing factors'' to the recent accidents, he added.
At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the number of U.S.aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashesthis week - were not out of the ordinary.
Aircraft on operational missions were not grounded, said Col.Miguel Monteverde, another Pentagon spokesman.
He said pilotsof those planes received special safety briefings but their flightschedules were not changed.
Desert Shield, the largest U.S. military buildup since theVietnam War, involves an estimated 700 Air Force combat and supportaircraft.
Williams said information about the number of flight hours inDesert Shield is classified and will not be disclosed.
The toll for accidental deaths since Operation Desert Shieldbegan rose to 31 on Wednesday when an Air Force F-111fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in Saudi Arabia,killing both crew members.
Williams said the Air Force was the only service that has takenspecial measures to review safety in the gulf since this week'saccidents.
``They're concerned about the accidents, they're concerned aboutthe number of accidents that happened so quickly over a shortperiod of time,'' he told reporters.
He said, however, that the military's safety record in DesertShield remained good.
Five U.S. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in thegulf area since the start of Desert Shield two months ago: anF-111, an F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet, an F-15E and two MarineCorps UH-1 Huey helicopters.

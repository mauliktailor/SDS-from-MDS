Introduction:Hispanics, whose incidence of diabetes is two to three times as high as thepopulation of the United States as a whole, can learn how to manage theillness at a free half-day clinic Saturday at St. Louise Health Center inMorgan Hill.
Heredity and diet appear to be the major reasons that 14 to21 percent of Hispanics -- and up to 40 percent in the 64 to 75 age group --contract diabetes, said Rochelle McNamara, executive director of the DiabetesSociety of Santa Clara Valley.
About 7 percent of the general population has diabetes, McNamara said.
Eighty percent of Hispanics over 40who are diagnosed as diabetic are overweight, she said.
The clinicSaturday will focus on three ways to manage diabetes -- diet, exercise andmedication.
Participants will learn that traditional dishes can be just astasty -- but healthier -- when made with unsaturated fats, and that exercisewill reduce weight, which in turn will lower the possibility of contractingdiabetes.
"There is no magic pill to cure diabetes.

Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row tomorrow afternoon.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover foraction against the UK.Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UKafter the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK.
A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, whichBritain and the commission say are working.
In 1990, certain bovine offals, like brain and spleen, were banned for humanconsumption.
British officials say that the EU single market will be disrupted unless allmember states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat ofunilateral action risks a collapse in beef consumption similar to the fallthat followed the 1990 BSE scare.

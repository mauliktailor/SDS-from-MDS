However, there is still turmoil in the diamond market,caused by uncertainty about Russian exports following 'leaks' of stones fromthat country outside its contract with the CSO.Consequently, Mr Hans Gastrow, general manager, says that this year Venetiawill process 4.3m tonnes of ore, 6.5 per cent below its capacity.
It is alsomining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne.
Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will bewell below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield atfull production.
About 70 per cent ofVenetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars500m.
Nevertheless,Venetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764.
Venetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years.
The mine has also revitalised De Beers' production, as it is accounting forhalf the group's output in South Africa and replacing production from its100-year-old Kimberley mines, which are now fading away.
Venetia's success is strategically important to De Beers because, when itsoutput is added to that in Botswana and Namibia, it gives the group directcontrol over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output.
Thisprovides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerfulposition from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel.
Employees are bussedin from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families.
Venetia is also breaking with the De Beers' tradition that, for securityreasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top securityarea once it is no longer useful.
Here worn out equipment will be stockpiledand sold off when the mine closes.
It could be worth millions of dollars.

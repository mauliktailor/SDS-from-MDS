Introduction:GOVERNMENT veterinary and health experts were yesterday putting outreassuring messages about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or 'madcow' disease, in the face of growing public anxiety.
Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer, yesterdayrepeated the official advice that beef can be eaten safely: 'There is noscientific evidence of a causal link between BSE in cattle and CJD inhumans.
'One cause of concern is that the number of cases is continuing to rise, inspite of forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture that the incidence ofcases would peak last year and then decline rapidly.
Farmers reported 8,581animals with BSE during the first nine weeks of this year compared with8,099 in the same period last year.
Another fear is that BSE could cause illness in humans.

Introduction:Scientists and engineers in Chile, which has the distinction of playing host to the largest earthquake ever measured, are waiting with serious interest reports on the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake.
Measured by magnitude, "Chile is the world's most seismic country," said building engineer Elias Arze, president of the Chilean Seismology and Anti-Seismic Engineering Assn.
And like California, Chile is still waiting for another "big one," an earthquake of magnitude 8 or more.
Both areas are situated along the Pacific "ring of fire," the huge faults created by the collision of massive plates of the earth's surface. "
The long history of earth movements in Chile has led to a sharing of information with U.S. and Japanese scientists and engineers over the behavior of the earth and of buildings during earthquakes.
"Our buildings performed very well," he said.
"We have so many earthquakes in Chile it has cleaned up our construction," Arze said.
Chilean buildings are of reinforced concrete with more inside walls.
"Our buildings move little compared to (those of) the Americans," said Arze.
Descriptions of earthquakes in Chile date back to Spanish settlers in 1575.
Just a few months before the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, a quake measuring 8.5 struck the central Chilean coast, destroying the city of Valparaiso.
On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern Chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year's San Francisco quake.
"It was the biggest registered in the history of seismic instrumention," said Kausel.

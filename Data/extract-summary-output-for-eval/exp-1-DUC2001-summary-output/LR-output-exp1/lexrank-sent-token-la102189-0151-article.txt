Introduction: The director of the county Social Services Agency wants all Orange County residents, including illegal aliens, to be counted in the 1990 Census, and he will ask the Board of Supervisors to support his position.
A resolution doing just that will be introduced at the supervisors' meeting Tuesday.
Agency officials said that if illegal aliens were to be excluded from the count, it would mean that, on paper, the county had 200,000 fewer residents than the county's actual population.
That lower figure would result in the loss of an estimated $56 million a year in federal revenue, they said.
Such exclusions, the letter said, could result in the county losing representatives in Congress because districts are determined by population.
Before Thursday's action, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens, although the House had twice rejected efforts to exclude aliens.
Orange County officials contend that much is at stake in whether aliens are included in the count.
In Santa Ana, home to 44.5% of the county's Latinos, city officials worried about the ramifications of undercounting its residents.

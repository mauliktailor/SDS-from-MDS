Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction ofYugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the mostpolitically liberal and prosperous of the country's six memberrepublics.
The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, MilanKucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the newconstitution will be the ``constitution of the sovereign state ofSlovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics),'' Tanjug said.
The proposal is to be discussed by Slovenia's parliament inmid-July, Kucan said.
Its approval is viewed as almost certain.
Slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and themedia in Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, andparticularly in the country's largest republic of Serbia, ofharboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interestsat the expense of federal goals.
More than 70 percent of the residents of the northern republicbelieve their region might be better off if it were outside theYugoslav federation, results of a public opinion poll said lastMarch.

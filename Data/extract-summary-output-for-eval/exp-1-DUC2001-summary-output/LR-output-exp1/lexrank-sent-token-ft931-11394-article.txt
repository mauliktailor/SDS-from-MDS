He told the National Governors' Association that he was committed to 'endingwelfare as we know it' with measures to finance expanded job training forthe unemployed, matched by a requirement that people must do some kind ofwork for their welfare cheque.
The president said he would focus on better implementation of the FamilySupport Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-forcewhich he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
'The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and theright support systems,' Mr Clinton said.
Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the newadministration's intentions, fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasison requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fallprey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding ofexisting programmes.
Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principlethat 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'.
Mr Clinton said he would let states experimentwith such programmes, even when he disagreed with them.

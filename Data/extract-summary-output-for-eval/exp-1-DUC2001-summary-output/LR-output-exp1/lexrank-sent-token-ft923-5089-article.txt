Introduction:THERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew, unwelcome as it was for thedevastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana, may in the end do no harmto the re-election campaign of President George Bush.
After a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster,both the president and his administration seem finally to be gettingassistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that havebeen destroyed.
This was brought home graphically by the president'sannouncement that Homestead Air Force base in Florida - a major localemployer virtually destroyed by Andrew  - would be rebuilt.
His poignant and brief address to the nation on Tuesday night, committingthe government to pay the emergency relief costs and calling on Americans tocontribute to the American Red Cross, also struck the right sort of note.
Itwas only his tenth such televised speech from the Oval Office, itself atestimony to the gravity of the situation.
With Mr Bush constantly in the headlines, Mr Clinton has been left on thesidelines, able to do little more than offer sympathy and sotto vocecriticism of the president's initial stumbling.
First responses were certainly found wanting, specifically in theperformance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) set up byPresident Carter in 1979 to handle disasters such as Andrew.
FEMA has, underthe Republicans, become the ultimate patronage backwater, with, according toone congressional study, ten times as many political appointees as thetypical arm of government.
Its current head, Mr Wallace Stickney, is a New Hampshire politicalassociate of Mr John Sununu, the former state governor and White House chiefof staff.
It is also Mr Baker who is making the mostof presidential powers to dispense largesse.
Yesterday, Mr Bush flew to South Dakota to tell farmers of an expansion ofthe subsidised grains exports programme and then to the General Dynamicsfactory in Texas to announce an F-16 fighter sale to Taiwan.

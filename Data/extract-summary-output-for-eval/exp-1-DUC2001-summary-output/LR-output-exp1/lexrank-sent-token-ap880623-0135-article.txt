The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which wouldrequire the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in thecountry legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used inreapportioning seats in the House of Representatives.
Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a Housemember another must lose one.
Ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number ofillegal aliens at 2 million.
The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to cound allthe ``persons'' in the country every 10 years for purposes ofreapportionment.
``I am disturbed by the implication that undocumented residentsof the United States are not `persons,''' Dymally said.
``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has countedall residents of the states, including both legal and illegalaliens,'' added Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``It was never theintent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionmentpurposes.''
And Rep. Albert G. Bustamente, D-Texas, termed the worry overcounting aliens ``hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement ofAmericans into western and southern states has had a much largereffect on representation than the presence of aliens.
But Reps. Tom Petri, R-Wis. and William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basicright to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congressto states where the aliens live.
And Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., contended that counting aliens``in effect, is granting representation in Congress to individualswho have entered this country by breaking the laws of the UnitedStates.

Introduction: Ben Johnson's personal physician has said the disgraced Olympic sprinter took a banned steroid on one occasion four months before the Seoul Olympics last year, the Toronto Star newspaper reported today.
But immediately after taking it Johnson suffered "violent muscle spasms."
"He was immediately brought to me and I nursed him back to top condition," he said.
Astaphan said Johnson was not on stanozolol when he beat Lewis in a world-record time of 9.79 seconds for the 100 meters gold, a medal taken away from him when he then tested positive for stanozolol use by Olympics officials.
Asked how he could be certain, Astaphan replied: "I must admit that even though I am his personal physician, there's no way I can keep a constant check on him. "
Johnson has said he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs.
The Johnson scandal prompted Canada to call an inquiry into drug use in amateur sport that resumes hearings in Toronto next Wednesday.

Introduction: A recommended halt to the government's ``let itburn'' forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of theWestern fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of apanel that suggested the moratorium.
Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance togrow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
But it also said that ``in some cases the social and economiceffects'' of allowing a forest fire to burn ``may be unacceptable.''
The panel suggested a temporary halt to the ``let it burn''policy, saying the Forest Service and the National Park Serviceneeded more time to refine their fire management plans.
Some 249fires seared 706,278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percentas much again in nearby national forests.
Residents in the fire vicinity complained bitterly that the park,tourism and the very air they breathed were being ruined by thefailure to control the fires.
The review team was asked to look at policies throughout thenational parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone.
The panel's report will remain open for public comment for 60days before any recommendations are adopted.
The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areasshould be allowed to burn until government fire management plans areimproved and strengthened.

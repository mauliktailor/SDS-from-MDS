The new surveys led USDA experts to predict the 1988 corn cropwill total 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from last year'sharvest and the smallest output since 1983.
That matched thelow 1983 reading, when sharp cutbacks in government acreageprograms, along with drought, reduced crop production sharply.
The corn crop is expected to average 78.5 bushels per harvestedacre, down from 119.4 bushel per acre last year, a recordyear-to-year decline of 34 percent.
Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chiefeconomist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of foodthis year, 2 percent next year.
``Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a majorimpact on this year's crops,'' Wilson told reporters.
``But becauseof large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most casesto assure and adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreigncustomers and meet our food-aid commitments.''
``This bill isn't as good as rain,'' Reagan said to the nation'sfarmers.
In May and June, before drought had made its biggestimpact, USDA projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and anassumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels.
But those projections were revised downward a month ago to 5.2billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainderof the season.
The soybean harvest was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year.
Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels,down 13 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987.
In May and June,the USDA forecast this year's output would be up slightly.
Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels,down 1 percent from last year.
Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percentfrom last year's harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212million bushels, down 53 percent from 1987.
Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1percent from last year.
Department officials said U.S. grain production this year isexpected to total 192 million metric tons, 31 percent smaller thanthe 1987 output.
In addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields, Wilsonsaid production of some other spring-planted crops has suffered,including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 millionbushels, down 24 percent.
The department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3percent to 5 percent.
Before the heat and dry weather, USDA hadexpected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumerprice index for food next year.
``That's on top of an additional estimated increase in foodprices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,'' Wilson said.
``Sothis would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.''
He also said the United States is ``looking at an exportsituation that is not as good as it was a year ago.''
Thereremained a possibility that the United States would import somesoybeans this year, Wilson said.
``The drought, as you can see, is still basically with usthroughout the entire United States,'' Strommen said.

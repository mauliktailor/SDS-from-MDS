Introduction:THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's effortsto fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issuedtoday by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president.
The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to makepoverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s.
The shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to makecomprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the thirdworld, allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty.
Headds that the new instructions to staff are intended to 'ensure that thesepolicies are fully reflected in the bank's operations'.The bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past bestpractice on poverty reduction.
The bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developingcountries within two years.

Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, areill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center.
Somestates such as Florida and Texas will experience near 200 percentgrowth during the period, the report said.
The only thing we can do is work on betterpreparedness and emergency planning.''
``If the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come,we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes,'' said Sheets.
Hugo killed 28 people in the easternCaribbean and 29 more in South Carolina and caused a record $10billion in damage.
Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity arebased on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves andincreased rainfall trends in West Africa, near the breeding watersfor most hurricanes.
From 1970 to 1989, there were onlyeight such storms, including Hugo, Sheets said.
There are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from Category 1,which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to Category 5,with top winds greater then 155 mph.
Sheets praised most South Carolina officials' response to Hugo,but said some leaders ``didn't have their proverbial act together''and lives may have been saved.
Also, he said Hugo showed inadequacies in the Emergency BroadcastSystem and some communities used emergency shelters ill-suited towithstand a powerful hurricane.
In the Caribbean, officials have worked to improve communicationssystems after links were cut by Gilbert.

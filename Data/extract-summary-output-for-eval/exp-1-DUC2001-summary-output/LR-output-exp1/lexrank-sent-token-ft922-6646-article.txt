Introduction:THE war in the former republics of Yugoslavia is forcing Slovene enterprisesto find alternative trading partners among European Community countries as ameans of compensating for lost markets in the region.
However, Slovene officials warn that capital inflows will not increaseunless Slovenia re-establishes trade links with its southern neighbours.
Butfollowing an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing warin neighbouring Croatia last year, Slovene exports to the former Yugoslaviahave fallen to 15 per cent of that previously.
The loss of markets in the former Yugoslavia, and the war, has led to asharp drop in industrial production, which last year fell by 15 per cent,and will fall a further 12 per cent this year.
Inflation was running at 25per cent a month last October, but by April it had fallen to 5 per cent.
'We have recently signed bilateral trade agreements with Croatia andMacedonia,' said Mr Horvath. '
Last year, total exports of goods reachedDollars 3.9bn, and imports, Dollars 4.1bn.
'Our enterprises are beginning to find new markets,' said Mr Horvath, addingthat Germany, Italy, France and Austria are now Slovenia's main tradingpartners.

Introduction:Hurricane activity off the U.S. East Coast will intensify,warned a weather researcher who reported a new method forpredicting Atlantic tropical storms.
Based on the new findings, Mr. Gray predicted earlier thissummer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be aboveaverage, and so far he seems to be right.
In July he saidthere would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of whichsix would be hurricanes.
The National Hurricane Center saidthat as of yesterday there have been nine named storms thisyear, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.
Wind moving acrosswarm ocean air causes powerful updrafts of air bearing seawater that eventually turn into rainclouds.
Mr. Gray said hebelieves that in the absence of moisture, these stormsquickly dissipate, but that the storms gather strength withadditional moisture.
Mr. Gray said his research, published in the current issueof Science, suggests that "intense Caribbean hurricanesGilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be theforerunners of this change.
From 1947 to 1969, forinstance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especiallyabundant, and during this time there were 13 severehurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
He found that the Sahel was especially wet from1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935.
Mr. Gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, theSahel is entering a wet period.
He said the droughtconditions ended in 1988 and 1989.
Mr. Gray said his research suggests that climatechanges in the Sahel don't result from global warmingproblems associated with environmental pollution but fromnatural weather cycles.

``I just hope that this case will draw the line on where thepolice can kill an innocent man.
Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, otherrecent incidents of alleged excessive force involved blackcitizens.
Police said they were told the prowler might have run to thefloor on which Barnes lived.
Barnes made ``a kind of lunging motion,'' and the officerfired from about 5 to 8 feet, Mills said.
Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajarand whether he would have lunged at the officer.
``We are defending the officers being in that apartment,'' Millssaid.
``We're part of the problem out there on the street, and we'vegot to get back to good, basic police work,'' Bishop said afterBarnes' death.
Joseph Okoye said officers who stopped him on suspicion of drunkendriving mistook his foreign accent for drunken speech.

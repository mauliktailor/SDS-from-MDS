Introduction: At least four moderate earthquakes rattledparts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along theNew Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely tooccur.
``This is just a normal day,'' said Waverly Person, chief of theU.S.
``There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely,'' saidPerson, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than25 years.
The center received more than 50 calls about the New Madridforecast Monday morning and hundreds last week, said Person, whobegan doing interviews for radio and television stations just aftermidnight.
As Person talked, 24 seismographs etched out activity recordedby monitoring equipment in different parts of the United States,ranging from Alaska to Tennessee.
A needle jumped a few inches across the seismograph connected tomonitoring equipment in Tonopah, Nev.
A few minutes later, the needle jumped again.
``That's not atest,'' he said.
``That's a quake.''
With a measured eye, he estimated the quake was magnitude 2.5 to3.0 on the Richter scale.
Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shakernear New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga.
A quake of magnitude 2 is about the smallest felt byhumans.
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,6 severe damage.
A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable ofwidespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable oftremendous damage.
This fall, there have been two in the New Madrid Fault area,magnitude 4.6 on Sept. 26 and magnitude 3.5 on Nov. 9, which ``isnot unusual,'' he said.
Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecastingthem is difficult, if not impossible, Person said.
The job, he confesses, ``is never boring.

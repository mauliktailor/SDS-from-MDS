Few would disagree.
Evenactivities protected by the First Amendment may be regulatedwhen they threaten the rights of others.
But Mr. Goldwin also writes that "The right to bear armsprotected in the Second Amendment has to do directly with `awell-regulated militia'"; thus, arguably, he continues, "ifyou want to own a gun, sign up with the National Guard.
"Clearly, this goes well beyond regulating to protect therights of others.
Mr. Goldwin's mistake stems from his having confused anecessary with a sufficient condition.
The Second Amendment,in its language and its history, makes plain that the needfor a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition forthe right to keep and bear arms.
What right must not beinfringed?
YetMr.
Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says,"that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in themilitia."
Thus does he reduce the first of these rights tothe second, when clearly it is much broader.

``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of peoplewho would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annualmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDSepidemic may be coming to an end.
A number of treatments for AIDSand AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many ofthem are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
``It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliverand require monitoring,'' Haseltine said.
``Unless we develop a vaccine, the future of this epidemicworldwide will be extremely grim,'' he said.
A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful,said James Mullins of Stanford University.
Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses haveshown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believethat similar vaccines can be found for humans.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
``We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades ofprogress in our tuberculosis control efforts,'' said Vermund.
There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis isspreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS,but that is likely, Vermund said.
He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic,probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the1970s.
Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis,Vermund said.

Introduction:CSO Riga, Feb.4.
There has been an increase in tuberculosis morbidity and mortality during the past year.
The total number of tuberculosis cases in 1993 was 868, while in the 1992 -- it was 771.
At the present time, there are no laws in Latvia that would require infectious cases of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment.
In November of the past year, the Department of Health of the Ministry of Welfare submitted a medical legislative proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers, which would require infectious cases of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment, explained I. Pavlovska.
The newest of these -- Ceplisi (in Ogre rayon), only started operations in January of this year.

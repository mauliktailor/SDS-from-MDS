Introduction:   Shining Path rebels have formed a new front topush their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas ,President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs explodedwithin blocks of the Government Palace.
Garcia spoke Wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebelattacks in Lima and a series of weekend raids around the capitalthat resulted in the seizure of five Shining Path safe houses and 31arrests.
At least 18,500 people have been killed in political violencerelated to the decade-old insurgency, which was launched in theAndean highlands.
The Shining Path draws much of its support from indigenouspeoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in thecountry of 22 million of descendants of European immigrants.
The wave of violence comes four days before a presidential runoffthat pits novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, a free-market activist,against centrist agricultural engineer Alberto Fujimori.
In one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upper-class Limasuburb, police found tons of Shining Path documents and propaganda.
Guzman went underground in 1979 and, over the years, there havebeen numerous rumors he was dead.
The raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed,Garcia said: ``The people who were captured were essential to thenew movement.''
Two people were injured in the car bombings near the GovernmentPalace on Tuesday night and Wednesday and Garcia called the upsurgein urban violence a ``desperate response'' to the weekend raids.
In other violence Wednesday in Lima, a city of 6 million, fourrebels armed with machine guns took over a neighborhood electoraloffice.
They forced the electoral workers outside and set fire to theoffice.
Firefighters said the blaze destroyed most of the documentsin the building, including identification for electoral workers.

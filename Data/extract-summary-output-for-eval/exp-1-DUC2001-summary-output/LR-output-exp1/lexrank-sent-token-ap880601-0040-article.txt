Introduction: A study has found that the U.S. deathtoll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previouslypredicted, the head of the National Hurricane Center said Tuesdayto mark the opening of the 1988 Atlantic storm season.
Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for theAtlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlierthought must be evacuated under certain conditions, said centerdirector Bob Sheets.
Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal countiesfrom Maine to Texas, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrierislands is virtually impossible, Sheets said.
There are not enough shelters to handle the added load and thereare serious concerns how new glass-windowed high-rises would fareif lashed by hurricane-force winds during evacuations, he said.
During a hurricane that struck Houston, ``glass was flyingeverywhere,'' said Sheets.
He refused to make predictions about the 1988 hurricane season,saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predictthe number and severity of storms.
The first tropical depression of the year has formed, andremained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip ofCuba, or about 200 miles southwest of Havana.
One of the two satellites used to keep track of hurricanes couldfail this year, forecasters said.
A previous GOES-East expired in 1984 and temporarily deprivedmeteorologists of Atlantic atmospheric photographs.
A typical Atlantic hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30, has10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained windexceeding 39 mph, six of which become hurricanes with drenchingrain and wind over 74 mph, Case said.
Hurricane Emily slammed into the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22,causing three deaths with wind gusts up to 110 mph.

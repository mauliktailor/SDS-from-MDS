Carbon particles indicatethe exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit.
And there are otherways to tell a fire was accidental.
He comes down to arson in most of his investigations _ and heand other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted insome regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames.
Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have brokenout so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwoodsaid.
``It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average,''said Ron McDonald, Mark Twain's fire control officer.
He said MarkTwain consistently is among the five forest districts with theworst arson problem.
``It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberatelyset) fires,'' McDonald said.
As one of the Forest Service's 125 special law enforcementagents, Smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigatingfires in the forests he loves.
The Forest Service is charged with protecting wildlands, andbalancing recreational needs with commercial interests in timberand mineral resources.
Smallwood's job includes investigatingmarijuana growing in the forest, timber theft and theft of otherfederal property.
The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists andarchaeologists to determine why fires are set.
``Part of it is tradition,'' Smallwood said.
``In thespringtime, people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow.''
A policy of open grazing, with cattle free to feed on anyunfenced land, was allowed in the Ozarks until the 1960s, longerthan in other wooded areas, Smallwood said.
Aesthetics even played a part: Shea and other researchers foundthat people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed thesmell of smoke in the spring air, and believed the woods lookedbetter ``burned clean.''
Over the years, timber has been touted as a cash crop that is asworthy of protection as grassland.
But the tradition of using fire to manage the woods dies hard.``There's no cut-and-dried way to prevent it,'' McDonald said.
``They just happened to be drivingthrough an area they thought needed to be burned out.''
Still, the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simplymisguided citizen.
``When they get bored withthat, they set fires.
And they don't necessarily have to be mad atthe Forest Service.
``It's so senseless,'' he said.
``It just costs a lot of moneyto put these fires out and it's coming right out of our taxdollars.''
McDonald, who oversees about 125 Mark Twain employees trained asfirefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress.
``An arson case in the forest is very hard to make,'' he said.``When you go out in the middle of the forest to a blackened areato begin an investigation, it's very difficult and frustrating.
``We had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arsonfire,'' Smallwood said, referring to a 1976 blaze.
``We would have liked to have prosecuted someone in that case.

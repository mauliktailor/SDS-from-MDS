The ``Chunnel'' between Britain and France is half-dug andscheduled to open on time in three years.
While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail linkto their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Railis dragging.
``Britain becomes branch line of Europe,'' a Guardian newspaperheadline declared after the government announced June 14 that itwould not fund a high-speed rail link between London and theBritish end of the tunnel.
The British resisted an undersea bondwith the continent envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a Frenchengineer named Albert Mathieu.
Napoleon wanted to build it butBritain warned him off.
Tunneling actually was started insubsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974 but they were scrapped.
The British public demonstrates little enthusiasm for theChunnel.
Random samplings elicit fears that it will import rabies,terrorists, invading armies.
``There is an attitude in France that this is a great project inthe national interest.
Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has providedfor any foreseeable problems, but stressed: ``We always made itvery clear that this was a risk project.''
Chunnel trains will carry passengers, cars and freight betweenLondon and Paris in about three hours, roughly the same time as aflight including ground travel, and at least twice as fast as acar-ferry journey.
Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percentof Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in thefirst year.
This past Wednesday, shareholders approved a sale of an extra$906 million worth of stock to existing shareholders, who alreadyhave bought $1.7 billion worth.
Assuming banks approve, the project would have a total of about$14.6 billion in debt and equity financing.
``History dictates that that will not be the last figure wehear.
But the order of magnitude of increase will slow down,'' saidRichard Hannah, a transport analyst with the London investment firmUBS Phillips and Drew.
``It's one of these situations where the more money you put in,the more you have to spend or else you're walking away frombillions of pounds,'' Hannah said.
Eurotunnel says it doesn't expect to p end ofthe century, and probably won't pay shareholders a dividend until1999, four years later than envisioned.
Themore urgent worries for Eurotunnel have been costs, creditors andcontractor feuds.
In October, concern about the rising pricetag drove Eurotunnel'sbanking syndicate to freeze funds for three months until thecompany reached a truce with Trans-Manche Link, the consortium of10 British and French contractors doing the construction, overresponsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns.
Eurotunnel says is can survive without a new link.
But cnt that shewon't spend taxpayers' money on a rail link.
The French government, on the contrary, is spending roughly $2.8billion building 210 miles of rail from Paris to the tunnel, with abranch to Brussels, where the EC is headquartered.
On the other hand, residents of Kent, in England's rural andprosperous Southeast, have campaigned strenuously against havinghigh-speed trains screaming through their back yards.

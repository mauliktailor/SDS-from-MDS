Introduction:   Three hours of steady rain Monday afternoon provided amuch-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared1,650 acres in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rainfall inneighboring Yellowstone National Park calmed three smaller firesthere.
But the nearly quarter-inch ofrain that fell Monday held it to 1,650 acres, he said.
``The forecast for the next two or three days is dry, with lowerhumidities and conditions more favorable to burning,'' said Damron.``But this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforcethe lines and complete lines that we don't have yet.''
Four 20-person firefighting crews from Colorado, Utah and SouthDakota were expected to arrive at the fire by Monday night, puttingthe total number of firefighters at about 430.
On the groundfirefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers.
Because of the fires, park officials Sunday had closed off someareas, but Vanderbilt said Monday the rain had allowed thereopening of the areas to hiking and camping.
The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, nearYosemite, was a ``bottle rocket,'' said the forest's spokeswoman,Mary Hale.
At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawathaforest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said fromthe national forest's headquarters in Escanaba, Mich. ``We're going to start releasing crews from this fire,''Bluedorn said.
``We'll continue to patrol the area to make sure wedidn't miss any hot spots.''
Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeksbefore the fire is extinguished.
``It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain,''he said.

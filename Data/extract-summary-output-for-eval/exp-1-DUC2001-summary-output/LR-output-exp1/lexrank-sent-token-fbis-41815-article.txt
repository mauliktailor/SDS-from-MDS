Introduction: Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of "mad cow disease" affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought.
Only one of the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep, believed to be the origin of the outbreak.
The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows.
It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others.
In THE VETERINARY RECORD, the scientists eliminate most routes of infection.
Infected feed cannot account for four cases.
Nor can at least three of the affected animals have caught the disease from their mothers, who did not suffer from it.
Because of the danger to other animals, the kudu herd has been isolated.
The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.
If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease.
If, however, it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger.

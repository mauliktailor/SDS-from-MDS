Introduction: Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said Monday.
The Academy Award-winning actress was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on Monday, her doctors said in a prepared statement.
"She is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further determine the cause of her pneumonia," the physicians' statement said.
Her condition is presently stabilizing, and her physicians are pleased with her progress."
Lisa del Favero, a New York City publicist for Taylor, said the actress is "seriously ill, but she's not on her deathbed.
We're not talking about anything terminal."
Taking a biopsy on the actress is called Sutton's law in medicine, after legendary holdup man Willie (the Actor) Sutton who said he robbed banks "because that's where the money is," said Dr. John G. Mohler, a pulmonary disease specialist at the USC School of Medicine.
"If you don't know what the trouble is, you grab a biopsy and study it, because that's where the problem is," Mohler explained.
If they (took a biopsy), I'm sure she was not responding to antibiotics."
Mohler said Taylor's doctors are taking a prudent course by placing her on a ventilator.
Placing her on a ventilator would be a prudent and conservative thing to do, even if she didn't have any difficulty.
It may just be a precautionary step in this case."
She was transferred to St. John's April 16 when her condition worsened.
Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly recurring back troubles that began with a fall from a horse during filming of the 1945 movie "National Velvet."

``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area,you speak to two and you get three opinions,'' says Rep. Kika de laGarza, a Texas Democrat.
``The best thing to do is to sit down andhave them all put it on the record and then sift through whathappened and see if anything needs to be done.''
The hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitationof charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summerfires, said a subcommittee staff member.
De la Garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearingsnationwide in preparation for the 1990 Farm Bill and will look atthe U.S. Department of Agriculture's response to this year'sdrought-relief legislation.
De la Garza said he hopes the House Interior Committee, which hasjurisdiction over the National Park Service, and the Agriculturesubcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the U.S. ForestService, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, theworst in a century.
The U.S. Forest Service said 5 million acres were charred in theraging blazes, including 706,000 acres in Yellowstone.
The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300million fighting the summer fires, the Forest Service said.

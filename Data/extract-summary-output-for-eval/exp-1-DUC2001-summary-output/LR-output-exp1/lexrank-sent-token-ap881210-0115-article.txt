Introduction: A top West German military officialsaid Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S. Air Force jet thatkilled six people will further erode popular support for nationaldefense programs.
In the city of Remscheid, fire brigade leader Berthold Hoehlersaid the body of a construction worker was pulled from the rubble ofa house destroyed in the accident, raisng the death toll from theaccident to six.
Seven people hurt in Thursday's accident remainedin critical condition, he said.
Later Saturday, at least 4,000 people took part in a torchlightvigil and procession in downtown Remscheid to remember the victimsand to demand an end to low-level flight training missions.
Rescue workers continued to comb thedebris Saturday, as work crews tore down the remains of demolishedhouses.
In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, the inspectorgeneral of West Germany's military said the crash was certain tohave a serious impact on already sinking public support for defenseissues.
``We are in a very difficult psychological situation,'' DieterWellershoff was quoted as saying.
West Germany, a staunch NATO ally, borders East Germany andCzechoslovakia, thus putting it on the front lines of the East-Weststruggle.
A series of deadly accidents has fueledgrowing calls for a halt to or drastic reductions in low-leveltraining flights.
Even before Thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents ofmilitary aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone.
Following the Remscheid crash, temporary suspensions of low-leveltraining missions were ordered.
The U.S. Air Force said in a statement Saturday that the pilot ofthe A-10 ``inadvertently flew into clouds'' while attempting to joinin close formation with another aircraft.
The Air Force statement, quoting Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson,said the pilot ``then initiated a separation maneuver as is normalif two aircraft in formation lose visual contact.''

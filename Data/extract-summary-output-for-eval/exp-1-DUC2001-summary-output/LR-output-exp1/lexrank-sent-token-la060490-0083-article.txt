Introduction:"Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.
Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales.
British officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of economic, not health, concerns.
Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales.
West Germany bought $50 million worth last year.
British officials have been joined by European Community commissioners in protesting the French and Germany import ban.
Mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since it was first noticed in the mid-1980s.
The cows become aggressive and then wobbly-legged before dying.
No one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow's brain.
But the prime suspect is tainted cow feed.
Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently.
On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died from a disease identical to BSE.
Panic ensued. "
Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British households had stopped eating it.
The government and meat industry fought back.

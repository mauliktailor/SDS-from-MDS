Introduction: Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson.
His life's story is amoving one, with its beginnings not in the black bourgeoisie,as Thurgood Marshall's were, but in the hardluck South, hismother a maid, the grandparents who scrimped and saved to puthim in school.
But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendentone: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.
His mother loved him.
And when she could no longer care forhim she gave him to her parents to bring up, and they lovedhim too.
He got loveand love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that hehad a place at the table.
This is something we in the age ofthe-family-that-is-not-a-family forget: the raw power of loveand how it is the one essential element in the creation offunctioning and successful people, and how its absence twiststhe psyche and the heart.
(The children of the mother oncrack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and painbecause AFDC payments are low; they are so consigned becausecrack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caringand succor.)

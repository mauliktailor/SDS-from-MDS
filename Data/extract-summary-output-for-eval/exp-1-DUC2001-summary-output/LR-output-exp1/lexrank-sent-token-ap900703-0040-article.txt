There was no immediate reaction to the Slovenian declarationfrom federal authorities or from rival Serbia.
Monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing anindependent legal system that would take precedence over federallaws and for Slovenian control over armed forces stationed in therepublic, state media said.
The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seatlegislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration ofSovereignty of the State of Slovenia.
Slovenia contains 2 million of Yugoslavia's total population of23 million.
The Ljubljana nightly television news said the declaration askedSlovenian authorities to ``assume control over units of the(Yugoslav) armed forces stationed on Slovenian territory,'' andsaid a 30 percent cut in defense spending would be implemented.
A coalition of center-right parties formed a new government lastmonth in Slovenia, the most prosperous of Yugoslavia's sixrepublics, after trouncing reform Communists in the first freestate elections held in Communist-ruled Yugoslavia in 45 years.
Theythreaten that Slovenia will declare full independence fromYugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposalsfor a confederation.
Serbia rejects Western-style democracy and does not plan to holdfree elections for at least another year.
The Slovenian declaration also said police should take overcontrol of frontiers with neighboring Italy and Austria, replacingborder guards deployed for the past 45 years by Yugoslavia'sCommunist government, Ljubljana TV said.
The adoption of a declaration of sovereignty has been underdiscussion in the new Parliament since the new government wasinstalled in May.
Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan, has said that Sloveniaintends to proclaim sovereignty as part of its drive for liberalpolitical and economic reform in Yugoslavia.
Slovenia and Croatia increasingly have sided with Kosovo'sethnic Albanian majority in its drive for autonomy from Serbia.

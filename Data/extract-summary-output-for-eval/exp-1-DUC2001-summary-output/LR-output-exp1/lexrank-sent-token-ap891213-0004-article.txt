Introduction: The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upperMidwest _ perhaps nowhere harder than in North Dakota.
The thirdstory in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,''examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmersmost in need.
``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray andchemicals and tires, they got paid.
The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 millioninto North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependentstate.
``If it hadn't been for drought aid,the economic situation all through North Dakota would have beendisastrous.
It was the major source of income for most farmers.''
A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conductedby The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside theMidwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousandsof farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more seriousthan the normal trials of nature.
``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg,another farmer in this Red River Valley county.
The state, the No.
Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banksand households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion, the study said.
The five states together received nearly half theassistance allocated nationwide.
Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million intoIowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.
``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major newwave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Beltproducers,'' said Mark Edelman, a university economist.
``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well shortof bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but itprovided a safety net,'' he said.
It was the same in North Dakota, which has struggled with anexodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading smalltowns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade.
``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' saidDwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist.
``We didn't get that in '89,'' he added, referring tocontinuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-centralsections.
Two reasons why: more acres of wheat wereplanted this year, and farmers don't have grain reserves to sell athigh prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.
Cass County also had a better 1989 crop but expects higherlosses in crop dollars.
About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farmsin Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres.
That's all I had really hopedfor.''
If that seems like a lot, Richard, who grows wheat, soybeans andbarley, notes it costs him $150,000 for rent, interest, seed,fertilizer, equipment and other necessities.
``You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop isgoing to be,'' he said.
``Our investment in farming is tremendouscompared to the average businessman.
We might not.''
Schulz, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $100,000maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or layoff help.
Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, hesaid, ``I was able to mark time in '88.
... Last year we had abreak-even type of year.
This year it was break-even.
Next year,we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.''
Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley,was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance.
Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mailpart-time, thinks the government last year ``pushed he panic buttonon this disaster thing and went too far.
In '89, they went too farthe other way I think.''
``Disaster aid is political,'' he said.
But Grindberg will persist.
``As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, ``next year'salways the best year.

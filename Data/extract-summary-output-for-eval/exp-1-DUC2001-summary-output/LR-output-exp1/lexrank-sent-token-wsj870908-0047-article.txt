Introduction: Flexing its muscles as a cartel, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month.
The rise follows an average price increase of 14.5% last year.
By changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said.
Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of the year, dealers said.
In 1985, at the low point of a deep slump, a top quality stone was $8,500 a carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980.
Demand is especially buoyant in the Far East.
In the first seven months of 1987, Japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added.
The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of diamonds for Japanese buyers," Mr. Lamont says.
Stronger currencies and lower interest rates in West Germany and other European countries also boosted diamond sales, he says.
To meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade, De Beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986.
Sales of $2.56 billion last year were the highest since the 1980 boom when De Beers turnover reached $2.72 billion.
Analysts are predicting sales of $3 billion in 1987.
Only about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say.
An advertising and promotion budget which rose to $110 million this year from $43 million in 1980 helped raise world-wide sales of diamond jewelry to a record 49 million pieces valued at $24.6 billion last year.
In 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says.
In more than half a century of its existence, the Central Selling Organization, which includes as members black African state producers, has outlasted other commodity cartels by never cutting diamond prices.
The cartel controls most of the world's rough diamond market via a "pipeline" that stretches from mines in Africa to Australia to diamond dealers and cutters.

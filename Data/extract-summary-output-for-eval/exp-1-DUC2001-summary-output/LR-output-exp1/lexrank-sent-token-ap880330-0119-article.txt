The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliensfrom its national head count.
Traditionally, it counts everyoneliving in the country.
Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to beincreased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributedamong the states on the basis of population.
That would continue a trendevident over the last several decades, he noted.
Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercountedminorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in theother would make little difference in the long run.
The only change, he said, would be that California would gainfive new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two ratherthan just one.
``That's easy to understand, since there are so manyundocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.
Expected to lose one house seat are Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa,Kansas, West Virginia and Montana.

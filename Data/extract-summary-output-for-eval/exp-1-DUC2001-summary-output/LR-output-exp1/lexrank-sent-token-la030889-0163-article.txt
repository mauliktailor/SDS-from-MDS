Introduction: Canadian Coach Charlie Francis, who claimed that sprinter Ben Johnson's urine sample at the Seoul Olympics was spiked with a banned steroid, told an acquaintance in Seoul that Johnson had worried that he might test positive.
Huey said she had seen Francis on a practice track at Seoul and he had greeted her as an old friend. "
Charlie came over to me and we started talking," Huey said.
"We were talking about how Ben might do.
Huey said she is tired of hearing Francis, who has been in Toronto testifying at a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport, say that Johnson was clean at the Olympics.
Francis testified that Johnson was not taking the steroid, stanozolol, before the Games and that a mysterious person might have slipped something into Johnson's beverage in the drug-testing area before the sprinter gave his urine specimen.

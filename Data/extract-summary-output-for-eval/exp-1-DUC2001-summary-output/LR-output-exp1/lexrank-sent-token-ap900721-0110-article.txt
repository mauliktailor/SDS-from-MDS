Introduction: Cloudy weather Saturday threatened tomar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hopingto glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening,when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weatherwith a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last83 seconds.
After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon willmove away, uncovering more and more of the sun.
Thereconditions there are considered especially good for viewing theeclipse _ weather permitting.
AtJoensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degreesabove the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers.
The sun rises unusually early during summer in the extremenorthern latitudes where Finland is located.
The sun comes upunusually late during winter.
Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an ``eclipse secretary'' to handlearrangements for the expected influx of visitors.
But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated theinterest in the event.
``We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we madefor this event, and our extra stock is finished too,'' she said ina television interview Saturday.
The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide fromthe northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the KolaPeninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands nearAlaska.
The last total eclipse to be seen in Finland occurred in 1945.

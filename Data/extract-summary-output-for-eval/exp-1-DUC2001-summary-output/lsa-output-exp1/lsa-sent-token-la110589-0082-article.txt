Measured by magnitude, "Chile is the world's most seismic country," said building engineer Elias Arze, president of the Chilean Seismology and Anti-Seismic Engineering Assn.
The San Francisco quake measuring 7.1 was comparable to the earthquake that struck Santiago and central Chile in March, 1985, killing 180 people and toppling some 70,000 homes.
And like California, Chile is still waiting for another "big one," an earthquake of magnitude 8 or more.
The frequency of earth movements prompts Chileans to say that every president has at least one major earthquake during the traditional six-year term in office.
Older buildings have been replaced over the years.
"We have so many earthquakes in Chile it has cleaned up our construction," Arze said.
Chilean earthquakes tend to be sharper and last longer than those of California, leading to differences in building design.
While California engineers have promoted a flexible design of steel framed buildings that allows them to swing in a quake, Chileans opt for stiffer construction.
Chilean buildings are of reinforced concrete with more inside walls.
"Our buildings move little compared to (those of) the Americans," said Arze.
In an 1835 journal entry about a stop the ship the Beagle made in Chile, scientist Charles Darwin described an earthquake he experienced.
On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern Chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year's San Francisco quake.
A tsunami, a tidal wave created by the earthquake, killed others and caused considerable damage in Japan and Hawaii.

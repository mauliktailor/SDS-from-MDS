Introduction: INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the RiverLimpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominatesthe diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
Also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared fromthe Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines.
(A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a sitebefore it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that RiverRanch had been bulldozed.
)Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with DeBeers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience.
He helpedAuridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he wasonce chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put upfor tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5mtonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in Marchlast year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them ofgem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.
Redaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp;Aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to330,000 carats.
The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy andmove a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZCorporation's diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.
While most of River Ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half acarat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6carats.
But as Mr Baxter-Brownpointed out: '330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.

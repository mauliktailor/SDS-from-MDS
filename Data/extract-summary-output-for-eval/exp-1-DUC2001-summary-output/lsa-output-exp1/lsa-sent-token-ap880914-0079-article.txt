Introduction: As Hurricane Gilbert's record-breakingfury sends Caribbean islanders scrambling for cover, NationalHurricane Center Director Bob Sheets remained calm at his helm.
The transition from former director Neil Frank, widely known forhis distinctive style and flat-top haircut, to Sheets, his darkblond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with agray wool-blend jacket, has been smooth.
On dayswith especially active tropical weather, Ms. Jorge steps in tocoordinate media interviews.
Interest in Gilbert has been high since it started packinghurricane-force winds last weekend and by Tuesday night became aCategory 5 storm with winds of 175 mph.
A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strengthhas the potential for causing catastrophic damage with winds inexcess of 155 mph and pressure below 27.17 inches.
The center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricaneforecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch on thehurricane in a large, open roomful of blue monitors flickering withgraphics.
And while Sheets might appear to spend most of his day with tinymicrophones snaking down his back and fielding media questions, healso writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every threehours and makes hurricane forecasts.
Dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealingwith smaller ones or tropical storms, Sheets said, adding thatGilbert has been particularly ``well-behaved.''
His previous experience with hurricanes has served him well inkeeping off the pressure during these sometimes 18-hour days.
``I've done this for 25 years so at one stage you're prepared todo it or not.
I don't feel a lot of pressure,'' said Sheets,while eating lunch.
Sheets said he remains in touch with his predecessor, Frank, butdidn't get any special advice from his friend on dealing with hishigh-visibility post at the hurricane center here.
``He's getting geared up in Houston,'' said Sheets with a smile.

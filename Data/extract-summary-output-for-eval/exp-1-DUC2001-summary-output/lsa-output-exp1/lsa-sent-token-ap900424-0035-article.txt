Hospital officials described her condition late Monday asstabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of thepneumonia.
Analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take untilThursday, said her spokeswoman, Chen Sam.
She was in the intensive careunit at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said MissTaylor's family was at her bedside.
Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.
Hercondition worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St. John'sand moved into intensive care on Friday.
``It is serious, but they are really pleased with her progress.
She's not on her deathbed or anything,'' Ms. Samsaid late Monday.
While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator,it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G.Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert whoemphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.
Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restoreoxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathingdifficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said.
Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,particularly back troubles from filming of ``National Velvet' in1945, when she fell off a horse.
In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pillsand painkillers.
Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drugabuse at the Betty Ford Clinic.

Introduction: Drugs are now available that can put AIDSpatients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that avaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel ofAIDS experts said Saturday.
He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDSepidemic may be coming to an end.
A number of treatments for AIDSand AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many ofthem are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
``It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliverand require monitoring,'' Haseltine said.
``Unless we develop a vaccine, the future of this epidemicworldwide will be extremely grim,'' he said.
A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful,said James Mullins of Stanford University.
Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses haveshown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believethat similar vaccines can be found for humans.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that anepidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the innercities.
``I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to thegeneral population,'' Vermund said.
There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis isspreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS,but that is likely, Vermund said.
Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis,Vermund said.

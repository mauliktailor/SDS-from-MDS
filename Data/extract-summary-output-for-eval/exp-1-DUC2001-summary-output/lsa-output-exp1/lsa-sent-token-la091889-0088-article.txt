Introduction: Third World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debts to the United States and other creditors last year than they received in new loans -- a major drain on their already cash-strapped economies -- the World Bank reported Sunday.
The cash drain has been growing steadily since 1984, when it was $10.2 billion.
The bank said that it plans to increase its own commitments for new loans to Third World countries to about $16.4 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $14.8 billion in fiscal 1988.
However, actual disbursements of loan money are expected to remain at about $11 billion.
A bank spokesman said that part of the reason that the figure is so bloated is that some countries, such as cash-rich South Korea, are paying off their debts early.
Still, the figure is massive by any measure.
The total debt burden of Third World countries currently is estimated at about $993 billion.
The debt service for this total -- that is, the payments to cover interest and principal -- amounts to about $143 billion a year.
In general, however, it said that countries whose governments follow sensible economic policies, such as in East Asia, have attracted heavy new investment and have performed well.
But others, such as those in Latin America, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, that are heavily state-owned economies and consume more than they produce, have not.
Drain Began in 1984 However, efforts under the Brady plan are going relatively slowly, and World Bank officials cautioned that the results may not show up for at least two or three more years.
Some critics believe that the plan -- designed to let debtors swap debt for securities -- may have limited use.
Until then, the richer countries had provided more in new loans to Third World nations than those countries paid back.
The bank also intends to step up lending for environmental projects.

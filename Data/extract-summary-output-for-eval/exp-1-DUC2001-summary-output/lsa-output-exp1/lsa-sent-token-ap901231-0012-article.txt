Introduction:   Mexico, where sun worship has passed fromancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early forthe day next year when the sun will be blotted out.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed aCabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as``the slar eclipse of the century'' on July 11.
The eclipse pathreaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil.
The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes,the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
People from British Columbia to Buenos Aires will experience atleast a partial eclipse.
Viewing conditions may be poor because of the Latin Americanrainy season.
Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million forpublic safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking inmillions more from tourism.
For three years, scientists and astronomy buffs have beenstaking out turf in Mexico.
It will be the last chance to see atotal solar eclipse this century.
Most hotels along the eclipse route are full for July 11.Tourism officials are seeking private homes and campgrounds,schools and auditoriums to house the influx.
Baja California Sur's tourist facilities can only handle 120,000visitors, and 90 percent of that capacity is booked, tourismdirector Rodolfo Palacios says.
The state says at least four ships will pressed into service asfloating hotels.
Some 13,500 amateur and professional astronomers from the UnitedStates, Japan, Soviet Union, China, Canada, England, France andGermany have confirmed reservations.
Some tourists have been bookedinto one hotel even before it is completed.
Others plan to see it from boats at sea.
Rosy rays of light will shoot out around the moon's edges,forming what astronomers call a corona, or crown.
Since September, the university newspaper has been publishinginstallments of a book called ``Eclipse'' that will be translatedinto Indian languages.

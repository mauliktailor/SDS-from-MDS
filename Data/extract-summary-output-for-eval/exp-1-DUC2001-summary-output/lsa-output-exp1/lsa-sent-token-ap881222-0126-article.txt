Introduction:   A U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed andburned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight.
It was the second crash of a Thunderbolt jet in Europe in twoweeks.
Another A-10 crashed Dec. 8 in Tracy, Ariz. Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, originally identifiedthe plane as an A-10 aircraft from the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing atRAF Bentwaters, England.
Howard said the plane ``crashed at 9:53 a.m. EST about four milessouth of St. Ives, or about 25 miles north of Cambridge.''
``The pilot ejected and his chute was sighted but we don't knowhis status,'' Howard said.
The A-10, a twin-engine jet designed to support troops by killingenemy tanks and other ground targets, is an older model planedesigned to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitudeand to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition.
Nonetheless, today's crash comes just two weeks to the day afteranother A-10 slammed into the West German city of Remscheid, killingfive and injuring dozens.
That crash prompted the United States and its NATO allies toagree to suspend all A-10 flights over West Germany until Jan. 2.The suspension was ordered as German political parties and publicinterest groups increased their demands for an end to low-levelflight training in Germany.
The plane is no longer in production, but theAir Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.
The aircraft has chalked upa major accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000flying hours over its lifetime _ which now consists of more than1.75 million flight hours.
The Air Force describes the A-10 as ``a simple, effective andsurvivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against allground targets ...
The aircraft has excellent maneuverability at lowair speeds and altitude and highly accurate weapons delivery.

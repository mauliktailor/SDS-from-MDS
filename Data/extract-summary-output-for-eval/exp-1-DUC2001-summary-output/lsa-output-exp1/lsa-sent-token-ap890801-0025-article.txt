Introduction: This week's flare-up of Western wildfires can't hold a candle tothe damage wrought by last year's record-breaking fire season, butofficials say a dry August could change everything.
Fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and rangeland since January in the contiguous United States, compared to 2.1million acres by this time last year, fire officials said Monday.
``Right now, the fire season is just starting to gear up,'' saidSandi Sacher, spokeswoman at the federal government's wildfirecommand post in Boise, Idaho.
Fire is a natural part of Western forest and range land.
Fire danger is highthis week in parts of Oregon, Nevada and Idaho, the NationalWeather Service said Monday.
Forecasters just now are trying to get a handle on what kind ofweaer August will bring, Sacher said.
This year, it seems to be fluctuating.
``They're keeping a very close eye on the weatt, dry weatherwith lightning strikes, that could be serious.''

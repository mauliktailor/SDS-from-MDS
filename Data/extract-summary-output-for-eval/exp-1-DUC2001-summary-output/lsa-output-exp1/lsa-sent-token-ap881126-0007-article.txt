``We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be, if not thefinal cause, at least a major part of the disease process,'' saidNew Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper.
Cooper, who has been working with scientists at OxfordUniversity, described the hormone research this week at the 13thInternational Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney, Australia.
Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulinsecretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in TypeII diabetes, he said.
In Type IIdiabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body'sinsulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high.
Complications can include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrenethat requires amputations.
It often can be controlled through diet and exercise.
Cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that blockamylin's secretion or action, opening the possibility of treatment.
The new work is ``a very important finding'' if amylin trulyblocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, F.Xavier Pi-Sunyer, an authority on Type II diabetes, said Friday.

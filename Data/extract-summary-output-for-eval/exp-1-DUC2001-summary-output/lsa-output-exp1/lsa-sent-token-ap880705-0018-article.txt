Introduction:   Three hours of steady rain Monday afternoon provided amuch-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared1,650 acres in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rainfall inneighboring Yellowstone National Park calmed three smaller firesthere.
Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blazethat raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park inCalifornia over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-dayfire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Mondayafter the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.
But the nearly quarter-inch ofrain that fell Monday held it to 1,650 acres, he said.
The rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100-man patrolplanned for Monday night.
On the groundfirefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers.
Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity,reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon andhoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning,Hale said.
At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawathaforest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said fromthe national forest's headquarters in Escanaba, Mich. ``We're going to start releasing crews from this fire,''Bluedorn said.
Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeksbefore the fire is extinguished.
``It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain,''he said.
The Fourth of July was no holiday for firefighters from nationalforests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho and other states who wereshipped to Michigan's central Upper Peninsula to battle theHiawatha blaze, Bluedorn said.
Forest Service officials, meanwhile, began assessing damage tothe 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlandsburned after the fire broke out Friday afternoon, Bluedorn said.

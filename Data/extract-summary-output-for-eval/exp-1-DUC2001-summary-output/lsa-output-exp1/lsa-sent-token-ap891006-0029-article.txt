Introduction:   Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knockedoff track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids,says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.
I lost my gold medal,'' the Canadiantold reporters as legislation to classify anabolic steroids as acontrolled substance was introduced Thursday.
``I think it's great,'' Lewis said of the legislation.
However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: ``Idon't understand why Ben Johnson's here.''
Lewis said he attended the news conference because he wasworking on his autobiography and one of the chapters deals withsteroids.
Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and BenjaminGilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented thelegislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlledsubstance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
``America is about to have an adolescent time-bomb explode inits hands,'' Levine said.
``But if we act quickly enough torestrict steroid distribution, and to increase the penalties forillicit distribution, we can prevent this plague from spreading.''
He applauded Johnson's couragefor attending the news conference.
While Lewis held the spotlight, Johnson slipped away toadjoining congressional offices.
``He's not here to compete with Carl Lewis.
I hope he willsomeday,'' said Ed Futerman, Johnson's lawyer.

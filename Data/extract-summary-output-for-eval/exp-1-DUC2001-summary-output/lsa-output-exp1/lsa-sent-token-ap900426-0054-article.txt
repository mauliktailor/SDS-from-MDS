Introduction: Elizabeth Taylor has rallied from anear-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out inher ``balcony attire'' to wave to reporters _ but is ``not out ofthe woods,'' doctors say.
``I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and Ibelieve that has now passed,'' Dr. Bernard Weintraub, a lungspecialist treating Miss Taylor at St. Johns Hospital and HealthCenter, said Wednesday.
About 80 reporters and camera crew members, along with some 100St.
Johns employees, jammed the hospital courtyard to hear thelatest reports on Miss Taylor.
Miss Taylor has had back troubles since she fell off a horseduring filming in 1945 of ``National Velvet.''
She had to undergo atracheotomy during a bout with pneumonia in 1961 that nearly killedher.
In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pillsand painkillers, and her weight has been up and down over the years.
In response to persistent rumors about AIDS and other illnesses,Weintraub said there was ``no suggestion of either cancer orinfections commonly seen in AIDS.''
The actress had issued astatement earlier denying she has AIDS.
Weintraub said the actress, hospitalized since April 9, remainedin intensive care.

Introduction:THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North AmericanDevelopment Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job lossesresulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Agreement by the administration isexpected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen intothe pro-Nafta fold.
The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out ofthe 218 needed.
It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants areason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it ispushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around.
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday gave his second impassioned speech onNafta at an exhibit on the White House lawn of products likely to benefitfrom Nafta.
He envisioned continent-wide free trade 'when we'll have over700m people in this trading bloc, united in believing that we can help oneanother grow and flourish,' he said.
Across town, the AFL-CIO tradeunion grouping on Wednesday had its own products exhibit, but those werelikely to be hurt by Nafta.
The speakers were workers who had lost theirjobs when their employers moved to Mexico.

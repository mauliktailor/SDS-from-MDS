Introduction: HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in UShistory, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana,inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing thelow-lying city of New Orleans.
Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday wasmuch greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely tototal less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a seniormember of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.
In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles perhour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City,Franklin and New Iberia.
Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land.
By yesterdayafternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustainedwindspeeds were below 75 mph.
More than Dollars 15bnof damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property,he said.
US insurers will face a billin respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.
Only one big hotel in that area has beenbadly damaged, a Holiday Inn.
Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday andhealth officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat allwater.
Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost theinsurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn.

Introduction: Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of "mad cow disease" affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought.
The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable.
The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
In the United States, mink have been affected by it.
The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others.
Infected feed cannot account for four cases.
Nor can at least three of the affected animals have caught the disease from their mothers, who did not suffer from it.
It is possible but unlikely that the mothers were carriers that passed on the infection without having symptoms themselves.
If this were so, it would have important implications for the disease in cows.
It is more likely, the scientists believe, that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along, as with more mundane infections.
Another danger taken seriously by the zoo, a world centre for breeding rare and endangered species, is that animals bred in captivity could carry the infection when released into the wild.
If, however, it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger.

Introduction: In his first race after a two-year suspension for drug use, Ben Johnson provedFriday night that he can run fast even without the anabolic steroid thatcaused his expulsion from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
But the29-year-old Canadian, whose indoor and outdoor world records were washed awayby admissions that he used performance-enhancing substances for seven years,managed only to finish second in the 50-meter dash of the Hamilton SpectatorGames.
His time of 5.77 seconds was eclipsed by the 5.75-second time of DaronCouncil, a former narcotics officer who now works in crime prevention for theAlachua County, Fla., sheriff's department.
They were attracted by the return ofJohnson, whose day of infamy, Sept. 24, 1988, has assured him a millennium offame.
He would merely have been a gold medalist if a positive test at the1988 Olympics had not turned him into the most vilified champion in thehistory of the Games.
Johnson got off to anuncharacteristically slow start and finished second by a few inches toCouncil.
"I got caught in the blocks," Johnson said.
"There was a lot of pressure on me because itwas my first race back, and it was hard to concentrate on the race with theway the fans were yelling for me.
"It was Johnson's first indoor loss in11 meets dating to February 1987.
"I'm in verygood shape, but I'm not in racing shape," Johnson said as he was escorted todrug testing, for which he was randomly selected.
It was adifferent-looking Johnson than the one who had bolted to apparent victory inthe Olympics.
Despite Johnson's trimness, he said he weighed the same --174 pounds -- and was lifting the same amount of weight -- bench-pressing 365pounds -- as before his two-year suspension for testing positive for aperformance-enhancing steroid.
"People are saying I'm smaller," Johnsonsaid before the race. "

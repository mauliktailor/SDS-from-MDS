Introduction:US INSURERS expect to pay out an estimated Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) inFlorida as a result of Hurricane Andrew - by far the costliest disaster theindustry has ever faced.
President George Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region sincethe hurricane hit.
It follows an extensive survey of the area bythe big insurance companies.
Mr Gary Kerney, director of catastrophe services at the PCS, said theindustry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone.
It is reckonedthe bulk of the damage - over Dollars 6bn in insured claims - is in DadeCounty, a rural region to the south of Miami.
However, the final cost of Hurricane Andrew will be higher still.
Yesterday's estimate does not include any projection for claims inLouisiana, which was also affected by the storm, although less severely thanFlorida.
The Oaklandfire disaster, in California last year, cost Dollars 1.2bn.
Hurricane Andrew leaves the US property-casualty insurers facing theirworst-ever year for catastrophe losses.
With Florida'sHurricane Andrew losses added in, the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn.
Wall Street, however, has reacted calmly to the record losses expected, andinsurers' shares - although lower initially - have been firming recently.

Introduction: LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one ofthe most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack forfuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor blackneighbourhoods.
Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed bythe scale of the violence.
Police could only look on, outnumbered, as crowdslooted shops, and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack.
The controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday, thefirst night of rioting, against sending in National Guard troops, and onlyto have bowed later to evidence that his police force was incapable ofhandling the violence.
That the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by theriots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on Mr Gates'sreputation.
But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removalunder a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and MrGates has developed political clout on top of this job security.
Six months after its initial report, however, the commission noted that ofthe 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutalitycomplaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from fieldduty.

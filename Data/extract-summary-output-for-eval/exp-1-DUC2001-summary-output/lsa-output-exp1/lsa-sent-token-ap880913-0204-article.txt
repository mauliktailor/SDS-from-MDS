Introduction:   Dealing with his first major hurricaneas director of the National Hurricane Center , Bob Sheets wasn'tskipping a beat Tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questionsat him.
But Sheets,rosy-cheeked and good-natured, didn't so much as flinch in his seat.
After all, he noted, ``I've flown into 200 hurricanes ... Ireally don't think this is difficult.''
The transition from former Director Neil Frank, widely known forhis distinctive style and flattop haircut, to Sheets, his darkblond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with agray wool-blend jacket, has been a smooth one.
On dayswith active tropical weather, Ms. Jorge steps in to coordinatemedia interviews.
A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strengthhas winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure less than 27.17 inchesand has the potential for causing catastrophic damage.
Those are the only Category 5 storms which have made landfallthis century.
The major television networks, local stations and newspapersmedia were on hand to monitor the hurricane, which could reach theGulf of Mexico by Thursday, said Sheets.
The center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricaneforecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch of thehurricane in a large, open room of blue monitors flickering withcolor and non-color graphics.
And while Sheets might appear to be spend most of his day withtiny microphones snaking down his back for TV interviews andfielding questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisoriesissued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts.
Dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealingwith smaller ones or tropical storms, Sheets said, adding thatGilbert has been particularly ``well-behaved.''
``It does what we think it's going to do ... You feel a lot moreconfident about what you're doing than with weaker systems,'' hesaid.

Introduction:"Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.
On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales.
British officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of economic, not health, concerns.
Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales.
Although other countries have recently placed some restrictions on British beef and cattle, the French and German moves were the strongest by far.
British officials have been joined by European Community commissioners in protesting the French and Germany import ban.
BSE-infected cows "degenerate very quickly," said a spokeswoman from Britain's Ministry of Agriculture.
But the prime suspect is tainted cow feed.
Some experts believe that cattle contracted the disease as a result of eating food contaminated with the remains of sheep infected with a BSE-like disease called scrapie.
Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently.
BSE has been around for six or seven years," said David Lewis of the Meat and Livestock Commission.
Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British households had stopped eating it.
Two thousand schools dropped beef from their menus.
Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef.

Introduction: Cloudy weather Saturday threatened tomar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hopingto glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast lateSaturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzlefalling.
The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. Sunday (9:03p.m.
The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last83 seconds.
Thereconditions there are considered especially good for viewing theeclipse _ weather permitting.
Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an ``eclipse secretary'' to handlearrangements for the expected influx of visitors.
But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated theinterest in the event.
``We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we madefor this event, and our extra stock is finished too,'' she said ina television interview Saturday.
During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have beenfull of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice forspectators not to stare directly into the sun.
Some eclipse viewers won't have to worry about the clouds,because they will be above them.
Finnair, the national airline, hasarranged a dozen special flights for eclipse watchers, and privatecompanies with small planes will provide more.
However, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than inlonger eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen fromnorthern Kenya on June 30, 1973.
Seppo Linnaluoto of the Ursa Astronomical Association said thebest place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeastSoviet Union.

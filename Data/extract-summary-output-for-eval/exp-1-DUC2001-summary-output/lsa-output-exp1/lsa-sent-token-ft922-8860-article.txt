In the directive, Mr Preston says poverty reduction is 'the benchmark bywhich our performance as a development institution will be measured'.
Headds that the new instructions to staff are intended to 'ensure that thesepolicies are fully reflected in the bank's operations'.The bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past bestpractice on poverty reduction.
The bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developingcountries within two years.
These would form the basis for a 'collaborativeapproach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'.The directive signals an attempt to impose a form of 'social conditionality'on borrowing countries. '

Hispanics who have strong American Indian ancestry may be vulnerable todiabetes because about 50 percent of all Indians develop diabetes, McNamarasaid.
Also, the high-fat diet of many Hispanics leads to obesity, which seemsto trigger diabetes, McNamara said.
The clinicSaturday will focus on three ways to manage diabetes -- diet, exercise andmedication.

The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries ofagriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits toallowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn.
Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance togrow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
But it also said that ``in some cases the social and economiceffects'' of allowing a forest fire to burn ``may be unacceptable.''
Some 249fires seared 706,278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percentas much again in nearby national forests.
The review team was asked to look at policies throughout thenational parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone.
However,it did not consider policies in other areas such as ordinarynational forests, where the Forest Service tries to protectcommercial timbering operations.
The agencies involved should make sure that fire management plansconform to departmental policies, that employees understand thepolicies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and thatagencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to moveacross administrative boundaries, the report said.
``No ... natural fires are to be allowed until fire managementplans meet these standards,'' the report said.
Another recommendation called for the responsible agency officialto ``certify in writing daily that adequate resources are availableto ensure'' that every natural fire will be kept within boundariesset by government authorities.

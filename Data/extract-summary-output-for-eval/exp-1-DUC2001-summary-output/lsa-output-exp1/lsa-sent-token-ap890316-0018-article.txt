Introduction: Scientists missed by 150 years in dating theoldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tabletthat also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researcherssaid today.
Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse,recorded on a clay tablet found in Syria, occurred on May 3, 1375B.C.
But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutchscientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happenedabout 150 years later, on March 5, 1223
Thenew study indicated the eclipse really happened in late February orearly March.
They compared those criteria and the likely age range for thetablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible fromUgarit.
In an accompanying editorial, Christopher B.F. Walker of theBritish Museum in London cautioned that their conclusion ``can bestbe regarded as a plausible hypothesis.''
The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and thestudy assumes that citizens of Ugarit followed an Egyptian-stylecalendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said.
Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed,it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solareclipse, Edwin Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory in LosAngeles, said in a telephone interview.

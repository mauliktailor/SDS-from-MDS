Several German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly knownas 'mad cow disease' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle -may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicinesmade with ingredients from contaminated animals.
'The danger that BSE can be transmitted to humans is minimal ornon-existent,' said Professor Hans Kretzschmar from Gottingen University.
'Contaminated British beef will be discussed at a meeting of EU healthministers on March 30, but a German official said that any decisions about aban would be made by the union's agriculture ministers, who were likely toargue that existing safeguards were sufficient.
The research ministry said that more than 100,000 cattle had died as aresult of catching BSE in Britain.
A further 50 cases of the disease hadbeen recorded in Switzerland and there were two known cases in Germany, oneof which affected a cow imported from Britain.

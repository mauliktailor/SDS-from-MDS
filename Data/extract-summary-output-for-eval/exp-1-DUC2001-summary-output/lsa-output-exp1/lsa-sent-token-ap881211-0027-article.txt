``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area,you speak to two and you get three opinions,'' says Rep. Kika de laGarza, a Texas Democrat.
``The best thing to do is to sit down andhave them all put it on the record and then sift through whathappened and see if anything needs to be done.''
De la Garza said the hearings would focus on forest firepractices, and ``can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or wasit a catastrophe?''
``I was in Montana and I visited with some people and I have someconcern over some of the practices of the Forest Service,'' de laGarza said in an interview last week.
De la Garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearingsnationwide in preparation for the 1990 Farm Bill and will look atthe U.S. Department of Agriculture's response to this year'sdrought-relief legislation.
The committee will consider a uniform pesticide labeling law andlegislation to protect ground water from agricultural pesticides andfertilizers, de la Garza said.
De la Garza said he hopes the House Interior Committee, which hasjurisdiction over the National Park Service, and the Agriculturesubcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the U.S. ForestService, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, theworst in a century.

Introduction:GUERRILLA tactics by Greenpeace were swamped by the White House pomp inwhich Mr Clinton and three past US presidents this week endorsed the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement.
But the environmental activists, who momentarily disrupted a House hearingto unfurl a 15 foot anti-Nafta banner, saw their stunt repeated again andagain on evening news shows.
With dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassrootsorganisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespreadpublic hostility against the pact with Canada and Mexico.
A new Wall StreetJournal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highestlevel yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of Nafta.
Fifty per cent of the Americans polleddisagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be createdthan lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so thatUS companies and workers could compete with Mexico.
Pro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting theopposition's success in framing the debate against Nafta as a pact whichwould cost jobs.
A Greenpeacerelease warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would beundermined if the pact is approved.
In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental,citizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus andother lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of thelargest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmentalside pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta's environmental safeguards.
Notable by his absence from the fray has been Mr Richard Gephardt, the HouseMajority Leader, who is said to be close to moving from tentative tocommitted opposition.
'I do not think we have articulated well - the supporters of Nafta - thevery positive and energetic reasons that can be offered for supportingthis,' Mr Foley acknowledged.

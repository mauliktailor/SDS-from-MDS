More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June,records show.

``People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes.
Last May 22, a killer storm flattened the small West Texas townof Saragosa, killing 30 people and injuring 162.
But there are some things you can do to protect yourselfand property,'' said Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for thegovernor's division of emergency management.
Take cover immediately and don't go outside, but if youare in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in thenearest ditch or depression.
At home, the best place to stay is a basement or undergroundstorm shelter.
If no such shelter is available, go inside a closetin the center of the house or bathroom or lie flat under a heavytable.
McIntyre noted that most fatalities in a tornado are from flyingdebris, so ``we tell people to squat down, cover their heads andpresent a low profile.''
James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for DisasterResearch at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly tryto outrun tornadoes in their cars.
During the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado that killed 53, McDonaldsaid, ``people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at90 mph.''
McIntyre said there are enough natural openings in a house toequalize air pressure, and ``if that tornado wants to open yourwindows, it'll do that for you.

``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake.
It just has todo with the probability of an earthquake in this area,'' Allen said.
He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of LargeEarthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,''presented information that was already widely known amongscientists.
Allen said this information should have alertedofficials to take preventive steps.
Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center saidthe quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale.
It was centeredin the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded onseismographs.
Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday'squake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.
It's something we should therefore be readyfor,'' Allen said.
``I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of viewfrom this earthquake,'' he said.
``What will be important is to seehow the modern structures behaved.''
Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures thatappeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in theLos Angeles region.

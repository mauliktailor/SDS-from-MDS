Introduction:SLOVENIA'S economic prospects would improve significantly if it could settleits relations with the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), or centralbank, establish new relations with foreign creditors as rapidly as possible,and join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Before Slovenia declaredindependence, any foreign exchange deposits which Slovene citizens depositedin banks in Slovenia were transferred to the NBY.
Mr Marko Kranjec, vice-governor of the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank,reckons Slovenes will have to wait years before they can obtain theirforeign exchange savings.
He says much depends on the negotiations andpolitical atmosphere between Ljubljana and Belgrade.
Slovene officials arealso anxious to start negotiations on the unallocated Yugoslav federal debt.
We will not renegeon repaying this debt,' said Mr Andrej Klemencic, adviser to Slovenia'sMinistry of Finance.
The debt-service ratio is about 40 per cent of Slovenia's GDP.
Mr Jose Mencinger, a member of the board of Slovenia's central bank, saidservicing that debt should not be a problem. '
That is a decline of only 5 per cent compared to theyear before.
So, we are not in such a bad position with regard to servicingthe debt,' he said.
However, negotiating what share of the unallocated federal debt Sloveniashould assume is already proving difficult.
Slovene officials say they are committed to repaying its share of theunallocated federal debt.
He and otherSlovene economists now believe that the European Community-sponsored peaceconference on Yugoslavia could play a role in negotiating issues related tothe debt.

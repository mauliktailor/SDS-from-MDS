Introduction:Opponents of any sort of gun control write passionately,but, judging from their letters ("Smile When You Say GunControl," Jan. 14) , they don't read well.
For example, one letter writer, commenting on my Dec. 12Counterpoint, "Gun Control Is Constitutional," felt compelledto instruct me that the word militia means "the wholepeople," a point I quoted three times and also paraphrasedonce in my brief article.
Thesubject is not just the militia but "a well-regulatedmilitia," people trained, disciplined and armed for defenseof the community under commanding officers.
That same correspondent accused me of calling for "removalof all guns from American citizens through the implementationof total regulations. "
I said thatalthough the Second Amendment has nothing to do with privateuses of arms , there is an unenumerated but undeniable rightto own a gun.
We have many rights not enumerated in the Constitution,such as the right to marry, drive a car or own a dog.
In the same way, the right to own a gun is not disparagedby being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled.
Oneletter writer who also knows something about theConstitution, though disagreeing with me on another point,agreed on the central issue, that regulation of gun ownershipand use does not violate the Constitution.
Registering is verydifferent from enlisting for active service.
Requiring gunowners to register with the National Guard would provide thekind of scrutiny the Brady and Staggers bills contemplated,and, if Congress dared, could provide an additional measureof control over who owns what kinds of weapons.
Elbridge Gerry opposed James Madison'sclause exempting persons "religiously scrupulous," because ofthe danger that it might be abused to discriminate againstmembers of certain sects, "to declare who are those who arereligiously scrupulous," and then keep them out of themilitia.
Plain and simple, it is no barrier to sensible guncontrol.

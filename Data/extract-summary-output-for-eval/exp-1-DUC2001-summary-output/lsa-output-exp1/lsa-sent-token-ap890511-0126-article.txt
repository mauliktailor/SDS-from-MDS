Introduction: The tuberculosis rate in U.S. prisons may be morethan three times higher than on the outside, federal healthofficials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and othermeasures to curb TB behind bars.
Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control cited a surveyin 29 states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per100,000 inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000reported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during thesame period.
Tuberculosis, a contagious, bacterial lung disease, occurs inabout 22,000 new cases each year in the United States; most can becured with drug treatment.
``Persons at highest risk ... are close contacts,'' the CDCsaid, noting that TB can pose particular problems in prisons, wherethere is often overcrowding and ``where the environment is oftenconducive to airborne transmission of infection among inmates,staff and visitors.''
The CDC committee also recommends new tests at least once ayear, rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms,and isolation _ off the prison property, if necessary _ for thosewith suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB cases.
AIDS weakens the immunesystem, making patients susceptible to infections other peoplemight ward off, including tuberculosis.
AIDS tests should be offered to all inmates with known TBinfections, the CDC report said.

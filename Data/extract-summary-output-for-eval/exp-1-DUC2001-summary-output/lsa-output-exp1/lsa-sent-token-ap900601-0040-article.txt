The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by atropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavyrain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into ahurricane.
The only thing we can do is work on betterpreparedness and emergency planning.''
The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo last yeartaught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate andprotect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from Maine toTexas, Sheets said.
Gilbert killed more than 300 people and caused heavy damage fromthe Lesser Antilles to Mexico.
Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity arebased on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves andincreased rainfall trends in West Africa, near the breeding watersfor most hurricanes.
Between 1940 and 1969, the United States was hit by 22 hurricaneswith minimum winds of 110 mph.
From 1970 to 1989, there were onlyeight such storms, including Hugo, Sheets said.
``I hope we don't catch up this year with the decade of the'40s,'' he said.
Both Gilbert and Hugo reached category 5, according tometeorologist Barry Fatchwell of the National Hurricane Center.
Sheets praised most South Carolina officials' response to Hugo,but said some leaders ``didn't have their proverbial act together''and lives may have been saved.
In the Caribbean, officials have worked to improve communicationssystems after links were cut by Gilbert.

Introduction:   Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused the UnitedStates of threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinianguerrillas attack American targets.
Wazir was slain April 16 during a raid on his house near Tunis,Tunisia.
Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, claimedthe threat to kill PLO officials was made in a U.S. governmentdocument the PLO obtained from an Arab government.
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphydenied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLOofficials.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United Stateshas been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries aboutpossible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
He added that Arafat's interpretation of those contacts was``entirely without foundation.''
Arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villain Baghdad, where extra security guards have been deployed.
The document, which was typewritten in English, referred toWazir by his code name, Abu Jihad.
It read:   ``You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern andparticulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approvedAbu Jihad's assassination.
``On April 18th (a) State Department spokesman said that theUnited States `condemns this act of political assassination,' `hadno knowledge of' and `was not involved in any way in thisassassination.
``It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafatmay have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks againstAmerican citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliationfor last month's assassination of Abu Jihad.
``These attacks will then be used to justify the assassinationof PLO leaders.''

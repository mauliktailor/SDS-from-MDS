Introduction: A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census isresolved with the decision to include military personnel stationedoverseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep countingillegal aliens.
The House blocked an effort Tuesday to require aliens to beexcluded from the census numbers used in House reapportionmentevery decade.
The national head count will be taken April 1, 1990.
The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of Housemembers from states where slow growth threatens to result in lossesof House seats.
Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, Westand industrial states like New York, and other states fear a lossof power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
The problem has been in deciding which states may count thesepeople as residents.
That has yet to be decided, but possibilitiesinclude counting the state where the person owns a home or the laststate where he or she lived for at least six months.
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban oncounting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 millionto run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year,including $800 million to take the census.
``Every census since the Constitution was created has countedall residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in thecensus, responded Ridge.
The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget forthe census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegalaliens, he said.
Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really overpopulation shifts that will lead to more House seats for southernand western states.
Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., said, however, that counting illegalaliens ``is not fair.
Census officials generally have opposed any attempt to deleteillegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in thecountry legally.

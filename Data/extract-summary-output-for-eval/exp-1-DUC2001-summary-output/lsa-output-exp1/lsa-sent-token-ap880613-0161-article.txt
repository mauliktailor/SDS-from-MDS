Introduction: Police captured the top military leader of theShining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla warhas taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.
``Forsome Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, thetrue leader of the organization.''
Abimael Guzman, a former professor of philosophy, founded theShining Path movement and is generally recognized as its leader.
Deputy Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said Morote wasarrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along withtwo women.
Police sources said two other men also were arrested.
Mantilla said Morote had fake identification papers but wasidentified by his fingerprints.
The sources said police discovered revolutionary propaganda,dynamite and a revolver.
Palacios said police had suspected Morote was in the house.
Palacios said the attacks were planned this week to mark the secondanniversary of prison riots in which security forces killed morethan 250 rebel inmates.
There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalrybetween Morote and Guzman, and Mantilla said he did not discountthe possibility that Guzman betrayed Morote to get him out of theway.
Counterinsurgency sources said Morote's capture will create apower vacuum within the central committee of the Shining Path andspark tension until a replacement is found.
Guzman, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went undergroundin the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which hasclaimed more than 10,000 lives.
But most counterinsurgency experts believethat Guzman, described as brilliant by his former professors, isstill alive.
Since 1980, the movement has expanded from its base in thehighland state of Ayacucho and now launches attacks throughout muchof this impoverished nation.

Thomas, 41, will be a judge on the U.S.

Thomas, a critic of quotas and affirmative action to fighthiring discrimination, has been highly praised by conservatives.
It became clear Monday night that Thomas' critics had failed tomuster enough support to defeat his nomination.
``Those cases might as well have been sent to Beijing,'' Pryorsaid.
``They might as well have been sent to Bulgaria.
They mightas well have been sent to Romania.
Pryor said, however, that Thomas was virtually guaranteed to winconfirmation and added that he wished the nominee well in his newpost.
Danforth, Thomas' chief Senate supporter and former employer,said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer.
Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., dismissed complaints that Thomas hadfailed to cooperate with the Aging Committee several years ago whenformer Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., was chairman.
``They wasted a lot of time trying to nail Clarence Thomas,'' hesaid.
Thomas was born in poverty in rural Georgia, worked his waythrough college and is a graduate of Yale Law School.

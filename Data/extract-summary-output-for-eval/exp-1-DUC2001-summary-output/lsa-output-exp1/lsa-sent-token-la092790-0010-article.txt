Students of government like me find it hard to understand why.
Contrary to most of the propaganda on the subject, these constitutional changes won't do what their proponents say they want to accomplish.
For example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections.
Forcing senior members of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the veterans already have.
This will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it.
Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment.
Term limitations throw away the benefits of learning from experience.
Why do we assume that new blood is automatically better than old?
Of course we should pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those whose performance we find wanting.
Why are we so certain that voters have such terrible judgment that they need a constitutional restriction keeping them from voting for incumbents they know and like?
It is hard to see how restricting voters' alternatives in this arbitrary way can be proposed in the name of representative government or of democracy.
One must conclude that other forces are at work.
More likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.

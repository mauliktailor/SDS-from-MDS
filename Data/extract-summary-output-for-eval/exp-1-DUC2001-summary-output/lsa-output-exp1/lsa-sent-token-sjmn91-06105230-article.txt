And for the sentimentalists, there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelleystarting in his 60th Boston Marathon.
There have only been 35 editions of thisrace run without him.
The last three Boston marathons have turned intoreckless speed duels.
They have produced five of the top 10 times and eight ofthe top 15 in the race's storied history.
They also have resulted in arace of attrition, with many of the early speedsters burning out completely orfaltering in the late stages.
Along the historic route that begins inHopkinton, west of Boston, and ends in Copley Square in the Back Bay sectionof the city, checkpoint records have fallen at an alarming rate.
Forexample, all 11 checkpoint records were shattered through the first 20 mileslast year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania.
Running alone about 200 meters behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passedthem all by 21 miles and went on to win in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, thesecond-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob deCastella in 1986.Ikangaa finished a distant second in 2:09:52.
Ikangaa is back again, alongwith several other formidable Africans.
Panfil won the London Marathon in 2:26:31, her personalbest, and won the New York City Marathon in 1990.

Introduction: Fire long ago destroyed the house where Clarence Thomas spent his boyhood.
Butnearby, down a woodsy, one-lane, white-sand road outside Savannah, Ga., sits areminder of what might have been -- the tired cottage where his sister stilllives, by a broad, shining marsh called Moon River.
There, in the segregated black Georgia of four decades past, began thetoughening of Clarence Thomas, nominee to the United States Supreme Court.
Abandoned by his father, driven by his hard-eyed grandfather and a band ofnuns sent south to teach black children, young Clarence learned sharecroppingand scholarship, hard labor and the Latin mass, and how to survive the walkhome through black Savannah in his Catholic school uniform.
From theseroots, he might have become one of any number of bright, activist black men torise out of Southern poverty and press a politically aggressive liberal agendaof civil rights and affirmative action -- as did men like Thurgood Marshall,the retiring justice whose Supreme Court seat Thomas might take.
Historically, trying to predict SupremeCourt nominees has been extremely risky.
Still, many liberals are convincedthat Thomas' past clearly shows his future.
He would, they say, opposeabortion rights, school busing plans and affirmative action programs.
Not surprisingly, Thomas'many friends and supporters draw different conclusions.
They see him as anindependent spirit, a probable centrist on a court that has been steeringrightward for several years.
There, just the other day, Leola Williams, Thomas' mother,talked about how the force of family worked on her son:"Clarence wassurrounded by all our older parents.
He saw how our family and other peoplestruggled to make a living.
Her house off Pin PointAvenue had gone up in smoke, and some months later, her husband went north toPhiladelphia, leaving her with two young children and a third on the way.
Williams took her daughter, Emma Mae, and moved in with an aunt while sheawaited the birth of her second son, Myers.
His grandfather proved to be a profound force inThomas' life -- a mentor, a role model, an unrelenting taskmaster and theembodiment of a personal philosophy that Thomas once recalled this way:;   "He used to tell me that there was no problem that elbow grease couldn'tsolve.
Thomas, who had experienced racialmistreatment by white seminarians in Georgia, ultimately rejected seminarylife.
He has identified an episode at Immaculate Conception Seminary inConception, Mo., in 1968 as the final humiliation.
He said he heard aseminarian there react to the shooting of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. bysaying, "Good, I hope the son of a bitch dies.
"Thomas left the seminaryand went north to enroll at Holy Cross College in the gritty New Englandfactory city of Worcester, Mass.
A Southerner in New EnglandTheSouthern farm boy was forced to endure not only the harsh winters of NewEngland, but also the chilly atmosphere of a white college just beginning towiden opportunities for blacks.
Within days of King's assassination, theschool created a scholarship fund named after the civil-rights leader andstepped up the recruiting of blacks.
And so Thomas, who was driven from theMissouri seminary by racism, became one of the beneficiaries of an effort tocombat it.
Thomas, who paid for his college education with loans, jobs andthe newly raised scholarship funds, soon was drawn into the turbulence ofVietnam War and "black power" politics.
He helped found a Black StudentUnion, writing and typing its constitution.
In December 1969, he and otherblack students resigned to protest the suspensions of black students who hadblocked a General Electric recruiter on campus.
Stung, school officialsgranted a blanket amnesty and the students returned.
Thomas went on to runtrack and write for the campus newspaper.
He graduated from Holy Cross withhonors and left for Yale University Law School in New Haven, Conn. Freewheeling liberalism"He came into law school espousing liberal viewsfrom his freewheeling, unattached undergraduate days," said Harry Singleton, ablack classmate, close friend and a former civil rights official in the ReaganEducation Department.
"I usedto discuss conservative ideas with Clarence and he was interested in them,"Singleton said.
"They were about the dangers of big government trying to solveall the ills of society and how every time you do that you take away from theliberties of the people.
"But it was Thomas Sowell, the conservative blackeconomist now at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, whose work came togrip Thomas' mind.
"But after lawschool, Thomas rediscovered one of Sowell's books.
Sowell's provocative 1983work, " The Economics and Politics of Race," was "manna from heaven," Thomassaid.
In that book, Sowell, arguing from a laissez-faire perspective,endorsed the notion that blacks would benefit more from pursuing economicachievement than political agitation.
When Danforth became a U.S. senator in 1977,Thomas stayed in St. Louis to work as an assistant counsel for the MonsantoCorp.
Reagan administration officials were so impressed by Thomas and his newconservative leanings that they appointed him assistant secretary for civilrights in the Department of Education.
Therecontroversy dogged him for the next eight years.
Congress learned in 1989that the EEOC under Thomas' direction had permitted more than 13,000 agediscrimination claims to lapse.
Civil-rights groups accused Thomas offailing to enforce other anti-discrimination laws as well, and of retaliatingagainst employees who disagreed with his policies.
Thomas concentrated onwinning relief for victims of actual discrimination.
He steered away fromlawsuits based on statistical evidence and remedies that included timetablesfor future hiring.
But he was unwilling to go along with more stridentvoices in the Reagan administration who opposed most legal remedies fordiscrimination, so he often felt isolated from both the administration and thecivil rights establishment.

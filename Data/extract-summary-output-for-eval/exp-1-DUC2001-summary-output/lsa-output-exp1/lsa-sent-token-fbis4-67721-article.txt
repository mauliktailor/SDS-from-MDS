There has been an increase in tuberculosis morbidity and mortality during the past year.
At the present time, there are no laws in Latvia that would require infectious cases of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment.
To this day, the proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers has still not been reviewed.
At present, Latvia has 11 state tuberculosis hospitals, providing treatment for tuberculosis cases free of charge.
The newest of these -- Ceplisi (in Ogre rayon), only started operations in January of this year.
Most of the patients there, however, are chronic alcoholics who suffer from tuberculosis.

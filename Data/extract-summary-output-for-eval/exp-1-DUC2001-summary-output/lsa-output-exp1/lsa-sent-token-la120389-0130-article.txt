Rainfall in the Sahel, typically associated with more intense hurricane activity, was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969, he says.
A second rainy summer this year indicates an end to the drought.
In the drier 17-year period of 1970 to 1987, there were only 13 severe storms.
In the '88 and '89 seasons -- June through November -- there have been five.
This September's Hugo, which ripped through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before clobbering South Carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h.
Officially a 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it "may be a borderline 5," says meteorologist Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars.
Fortunately, most Atlantic-region hurricanes do not develop to their worst potential.
In 1980, Allen, the mightiest Caribbean storm then recorded, had lost much of its punch before it hit the Gulf Coast of Texas. "
But in the 1990s, he warns, U.S. destruction will be at least four to five times more costly than in the '50s and '60s, because of the boom in population and property development along coastal areas.
Hurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea.
They get their power from the water's warmth.
To develop, they need tropical ocean-surface temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. "
If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will," Emanuel explains.
The biggest uncertainty, he says, is whether global warming will affect tropical ocean temperatures.

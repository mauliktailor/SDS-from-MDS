Introduction: Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson.
This israther a burden to put on any man or woman but it isinevitable in his case because he is young, gifted and blackand now the center of one great row.
His life's story is amoving one, with its beginnings not in the black bourgeoisie,as Thurgood Marshall's were, but in the hardluck South, hismother a maid, the grandparents who scrimped and saved to puthim in school.
A question is which lesson his life best demonstrates.
But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendentone: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.
And when she could no longer care forhim she gave him to her parents to bring up, and they lovedhim too.
He got loveand love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that hehad a place at the table.
(The children of the mother oncrack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and painbecause AFDC payments are low; they are so consigned becausecrack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caringand succor.)

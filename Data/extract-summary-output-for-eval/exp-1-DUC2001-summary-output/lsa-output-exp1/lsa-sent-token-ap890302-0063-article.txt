Introduction: Drug abusers who are infected with the AIDS virusand tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to preventfull-blown TB, says a study published today.
The doctors warned that besides being at risk of gettingtuberculosis themselves, AIDS-infected addicts who carry the TBbacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with, to healthcare workers and other people.
People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteriafor many years without getting sick.
While most people with the AIDSvirus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome,people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have onlyabout a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB.
The study suggests that it lowers resistance to thetuberculosis bacteria, putting people at much higher risk of TB.
The study was conducted on 520 drug users who were in a methadoneprogram.
When the study began, 42 percent already were infected withHIV.
Seven of the eight TB cases occurred in peoplewho were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before thestudy began.
The doctors noted that 13 people who carried HIV and TB bacteriawere treated with the drug isoniazid, and none of them went on toget active tuberculosis.
However, seven of 36 people with bothinfections who did not take the medicine got TB.

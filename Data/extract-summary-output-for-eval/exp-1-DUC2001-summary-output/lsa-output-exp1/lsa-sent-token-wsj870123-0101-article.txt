Introduction: In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.
He instructed his charges to draw up plans for "immediate action" that would enable poor families to achieve "real and lasting emancipation" from welfare dependency. "
The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families.
Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty.
If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.
His Domestic Policy Council has drafted a blueprint.
It would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs.
Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform.
The president will need all the help he can get if he is to convince Democrats in Congress to go along.
Most have paid lip service to the idea of welfare reform but nary a bill has been put on the docket.
This past December, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in Washington, issued a "statement of principles" calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs.
It also insisted that the federal government has "primary responsibility" for operating welfare.
Congressional Democrats seem to be in agreement with the welfare lobby.
It will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $100 billion a year on these programs.

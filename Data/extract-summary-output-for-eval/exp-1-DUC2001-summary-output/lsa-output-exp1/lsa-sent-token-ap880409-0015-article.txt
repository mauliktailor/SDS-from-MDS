Introduction: A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer inthe Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas,but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threatenpopulated areas.
The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of thelast six hurricane seasons.
Those years brought just two to fivehurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.
Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annualhurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his firstformal 1988 forecast in late May.
He issued an early ``outlook''Friday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference.
But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around theequator and winds for ``El Nino'' periods, when eastern Pacificwaters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of whenor where a hurricane might form.
His prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and heoriginally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figureto seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985.
He said the droughthas robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start theirescalation into hurricanes.
Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conferencestressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during thelull in hurricanes; a surge in storms, up to the levels of the1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.

There was no immediate reaction to the Slovenian declarationfrom federal authorities or from rival Serbia.
Monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing anindependent legal system that would take precedence over federallaws and for Slovenian control over armed forces stationed in therepublic, state media said.
The republic's new authorities demand that Yugoslavia transformitself into a loose confederation of sovereign states.
Theythreaten that Slovenia will declare full independence fromYugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposalsfor a confederation.
Premier Lojze Peterle and other Slovenian leaders also saySlovenia should take urgent steps to join the European Community,no matter what Yugoslavia's Communist-ruled southern states say.
Serbia rejects Western-style democracy and does not plan to holdfree elections for at least another year.
The Slovenian declaration also said police should take overcontrol of frontiers with neighboring Italy and Austria, replacingborder guards deployed for the past 45 years by Yugoslavia'sCommunist government, Ljubljana TV said.
Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan, has said that Sloveniaintends to proclaim sovereignty as part of its drive for liberalpolitical and economic reform in Yugoslavia.
The timing of Monday's proclamation by Slovenia may have beenaffected by Serbia's sudden decision last week to hold a specialreferendum Sunday and Monday on adopting consitutional reforms thatwould virtually destroy any remaining autonomy for its troubledprovince of Kosovo.
Slovenia and Croatia increasingly have sided with Kosovo'sethnic Albanian majority in its drive for autonomy from Serbia.
In Kosovo's capital of Pristina, after Serbian police on Mondaybarred about 100 ethnic Albanian deputies from entering theprovince's Parliament, about 40 deputies proclaimed Kosovo equal tothe six Yugoslav republics.
The deputies want to revoke a constitutional amendment that gaveSerbia almost total control over Kosovo.

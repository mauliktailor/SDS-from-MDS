``This is a fairness issue,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa.,who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliensbenefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extraseats in the House.
The result, he said, was that Georgiaand Indiana lost House seats to New York and California.
Subcommittee Chairman Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., however, saidhe is unsure whether the bills backed by Ridge and others areconstitutional.
Noting that at times in the past blacks and Indians have beenexcluded from participation in government, he commented: ``I do notwant to return to a time when some human beings are considered lessthan equal in the eyes of the law.''
``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has countedall residents of the states, including both legal and illegalaliens,'' added Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``It was never theintent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionmentpurposes.''
And Rep. Albert G. Bustamente, D-Texas, termed the worry overcounting aliens ``hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement ofAmericans into western and southern states has had a much largereffect on representation than the presence of aliens.
The Census Bureau also opposes the bills, contending that theeffort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay andcomplicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell thetruth anyway.
But Reps. Tom Petri, R-Wis. and William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basicright to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congressto states where the aliens live.
And Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., contended that counting aliens``in effect, is granting representation in Congress to individualswho have entered this country by breaking the laws of the UnitedStates.

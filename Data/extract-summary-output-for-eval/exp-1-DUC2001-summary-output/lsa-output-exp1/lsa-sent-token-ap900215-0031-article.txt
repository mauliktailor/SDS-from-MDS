The research found that when living conditions are identical,black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with theTB bacteria.
While social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the studysuggests that innate susceptibility also contributes.
``We found that there is a systemic difference between whitesand blacks,'' said Dr. William W. Stead.
Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department ofHealth, discovered the racial difference while analyzing healthstatistics from nursing homes and prisons.
``It's a very intriguing finding,'' commented Dr. GeorgeComstock of Johns Hopkins University.
But I don't know of any realholes in this one.''

However, he added: ``I'm scared to death that people are goingto say this explains it all and forget everything else.
Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that blackinmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch thebacteria while incarcerated.
In the population atlarge, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks aswhites.
An estimated 10 million Americans are believed to be infectedwith the bacteria but not sick.
The disease, which attacks thelungs, has long been associated with poor, crowded livingconditions.
This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infectedwhites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.
Stead speculated that whites have evolved better defensesagainst TB, because the bacteria has long been common in Europe andparts of Africa north of the Sahara, but is traditionally rare insub-Saharan Africa.
By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whitesto malaria, which is common in Africa.
Inblacks, these cells are more likely to harbor TB infections.
The number of cases fell steadily in recent decades until1984.
Others possible factors include homelessness andimmigration of people from areas where the disease is still common.

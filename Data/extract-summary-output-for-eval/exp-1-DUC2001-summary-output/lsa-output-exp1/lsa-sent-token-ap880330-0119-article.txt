The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliensfrom its national head count.
Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to beincreased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
``If both sides get their way, the only change would be aflip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said WilliamO'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent PopulationReference Bureau.
O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for Northeast and Midwestmembers of Congress that he estimates their region will lose 14House seats following the 1990 census.
That would continue a trendevident over the last several decades, he noted.
``That's easy to understand, since there are so manyundocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.
O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to bethe big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with again of four and Texas adding three.
Expected to pick up one seat each are Virginia, North Carolina,Georgia, and Arizona.
Expected to lose one house seat are Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa,Kansas, West Virginia and Montana.

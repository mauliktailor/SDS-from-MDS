Introduction: The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a banon British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE).The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legalaction if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officialssaid yesterday.
The commissionhas reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and thatthere is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE andCreutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
In 1990, certain bovine offals, like brain and spleen, were banned for humanconsumption.
In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as comingfrom herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.
'We feel we have a sound case and other member states and the Commissionagree with us,' a senior British agriculture official said.

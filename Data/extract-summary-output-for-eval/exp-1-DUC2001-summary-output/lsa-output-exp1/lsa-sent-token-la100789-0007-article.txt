Introduction: This is not an argument regarding the merits of gun control laws.
Second Amendment states (1791): "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
As often happens in law, a simple English sentence may have legal significance which determines the application of the words.
The word "people" as used in constitutional law is used collectively and refers to a political entity, such as a state, and does not mean "persons" or individuals.
There have been lower federal court decisions regarding the Second Amendment, all supportive of this established principle.
2) Not a federally protected right of individuals.
There is no national document controlling the states with regard to arms.
The states may regulate arms within their borders.

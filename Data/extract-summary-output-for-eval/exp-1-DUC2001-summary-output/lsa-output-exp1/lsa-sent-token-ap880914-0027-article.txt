The previous record low pressure of26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struckthe Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, hesaid.
But because the circumference of a hurricane changesso often during its course, no records are kept on their overallsize, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold tohurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probablyabout half that size, Moore said.
Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemispheresince weather officials began keeping detailed records.
A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disasterin U.S. history, however.
That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8and killed more than 6,000 people.
The storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye ofthe hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path_ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.
Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane centerwas forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
``Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,'' Zimmersaid.
If the atmospheric conditions in general allow thiswarm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, thenyou can have a severe hurricane.''
Theweakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.

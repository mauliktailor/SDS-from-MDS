Introduction: Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said Monday.
"She is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further determine the cause of her pneumonia," the physicians' statement said.
"After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator. "
Lisa del Favero, a New York City publicist for Taylor, said the actress is "seriously ill, but she's not on her deathbed.
Taylor's doctors expect to have results of the biopsy by Thursday, she said.
"If you don't know what the trouble is, you grab a biopsy and study it, because that's where the problem is," Mohler explained.
"You study the biopsy because that will dictate your therapy.
If they (took a biopsy), I'm sure she was not responding to antibiotics."
She suffered a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, and Mohler said "it would seem that there is something basically wrong with her lung structure or function.
It may just be a precautionary step in this case."
She was transferred to St. John's April 16 when her condition worsened.
Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist, said in a statement last week that Taylor had pneumonia and was "being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized (indefinitely). "
Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly recurring back troubles that began with a fall from a horse during filming of the 1945 movie "National Velvet."
Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse problems at the Betty Ford Clinic.

Introduction:THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiformencephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelopepopulation, the government has admitted.
In all, six species other thancattle have been confirmed with the condition during this period.
Mr David Maclean, junior agriculture minister, stressed that naturallyoccurring spongiform encephalopathies in species other than cattle were notnotifiable diseases.
Scrapie, he said, was considered to be transmissible 'both maternally andhorizontally'.

Introduction: An official statement issued Fridayconfirmed that federal military commanders met in March andconsidered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia.
Slovenia is considered the most liberal of Yugoslavia's sixrepublics and two autonomous provinces.
But it said there was no discussion at the meeting ``about aplan for action against special warfare in Slovenia.''
Slovenia's Communist Party presidium also ``expresseddisagreement with part of the military council's opinions,'' saidthe statement.
Some army commanders have been increasingly critical ofSlovenia's leadership, saying it should act firmly againstpolitical dissidents.
And Slovenian Communists have frequentlycriticized the way the federal government is dealing with thecountry's economic and social problems.
It published a letter to Slovenia's Communist Party leader MilanKucan from two student unions that said military action had beenplanned earlier this year, including the arrests of ``nonconformistjournalists, writers and officials.''
The plan was blocked byKucan and Stane Dolanc, Slovenia's member in Yugoslavia'scollective presidency, after they were told about it by Sloveniansecurity organizations, the letter said.
Svetozar Visnjic, commander of Ljubljana's military command,dismissed the reports of planned military action as ``nonsense anda fabrication.''
He made the comment in an interview with theBelgrade Politika Ekspres newspaper.

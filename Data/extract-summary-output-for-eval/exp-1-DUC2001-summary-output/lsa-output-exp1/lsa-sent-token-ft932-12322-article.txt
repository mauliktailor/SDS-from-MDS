Poverty reductionmust be the benchmark against which our performance as a developmentinstitution is judged,' he said.
In congressional testimony this week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasurysecretary, said the US wanted to see more funding that 'will create socialand economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strifeand economic mismanagement. '
'In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed toinclude specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from MrPreston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief.
The share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' isstill only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from Mr Preston for anincreased emphasis on investment in people.
At a news conference Mr Preston said the bank was making progress: a decadeago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development andonly 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus onpoverty.
But he said the bank had a 'long, long way to go'.
This highlights the diversity of performance on poverty reduction in thethird world.
Mr Preston said bank efforts to reduce poverty could succeed only ifgovernments concerned co-operated.
Officials cited Indonesia, China, Mexico,and El Salvador as examples of countries that were co-operating well butdeclined to name poor performers.
He said hoped for a clear signal from this week's meeting of the Group ofSeven leading industrial countries that they would deliver on commitmentsfor a Dollars 18bn replenishment of resources for the InternationalDevelopment Agency (IDA), the centrepiece of bank efforts to reduce poverty.

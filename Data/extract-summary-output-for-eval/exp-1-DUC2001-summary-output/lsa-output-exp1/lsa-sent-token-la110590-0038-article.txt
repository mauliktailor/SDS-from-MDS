Introduction: Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz.
Douglas Wakiihuri, a Kenyan who trains in Japan, was the overall winner and Poland's Wanda Panfil, who lives in Mexico, was the women's winner in Sunday's race which was plagued by heat and humidity.
It was the third consecutive marathon victory for each.
Ikangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by winning in course-record time, and Waitz, who had won the race nine times, each ran fourth in their respective divisions.
For Waitz, the result was different than anything she had experienced in New York.
The last American women's champion was Miki Gorman in 1977.
It was the slowest winning women's time since Waitz's 2:32:30 in 1978.
Wakiihuri, who bolted away at 20 miles, clocked 2:12:39, the slowest since Orlando Pizzolato of Italy won in 2:14:53 in 1984, when the temperature reached 79 degrees, the hottest in race history.
Ken Martin of Dallas, the runner-up last year, failed to finish this time.
Bothered by a virus for the past two months, he dropped out after 19 miles.
Mohamed Idris of Brooklyn, N.Y., who finished 22nd in 2:22:23, originally was announced as the top American, but race officials later determined he was an Egyptian citizen.
He also finished second in the 1988 Olympic Games.

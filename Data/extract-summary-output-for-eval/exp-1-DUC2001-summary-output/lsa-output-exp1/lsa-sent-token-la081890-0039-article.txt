Introduction:Alphonce Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania, but who later fell prey to alcoholism, continues his comeback bid in Sunday's America's Finest City HomeFed Half Marathon.
It will wind its way to the finish line in Balboa Park.
The Goodwill Games victory came despite Swai's taking a wrong turn and running 150 yards in another direction before getting back on track.
Now Swai, 26, is looking to turn in a 1:02 or 1:03 on Sunday.
The runners Swai fears most include: Carlos Ayala of Mexico City, who finished fourth in this year's Grandma's Marathon; Jose Luis Chuela of Mexico, who was second in this race in 1988 (1:03:42); Sam Sitonik of Kenya, who placed fourth in the 1987 America's Finest City Half Marathon at 1:06:01; and Sammy Rotich, a Kenyan who ran a personal best 1:01:55 in 1987.
The women's field is led by Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash. Track &amp; Field News ranked Jones third among women marathoners in 1989 and first among U.S. competitors.
She will be challenged by Janine Aiello of Toas, N.M., who placed second in this year's San Francisco Marathon; Lynn DeNinnof of St. Louis, who won a gold medal in the 10 kilometer at the 1990 TAC championships; and Kathryn Evans of Fort Collins, Colo., winner of the 1990 Nebraska Half Marathon.
The course is considered by runners to be a difficult one -- so difficult, in fact, that most elite runners who train in San Diego stay away from the race.
You can't just go out and run hard on this course."

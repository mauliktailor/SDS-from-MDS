Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had justfinished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when twoassassins opened fire with .45-caliber pistols, police said.
Lydio Zeta quoted witnesses as saying the gunmenshouted ``We are NPAs,'' referring to the rebel New People's Army,and warned bystanders not to interfere.
They fled in a commandeeredpassenger jeep after taking Taylo's pistol, Zeta said.
The New People's Army also claimed responsibility for the April21 assassination of U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe, who wasslain on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Groupheadquarters in suburban Quezon City.
Gen. Alexander Aguirre,Capital Region commander, announced formation of a special taskforce to track down rebel assassins in the capital.
``It is really very unfortunate and I do sympathize with thefamily of Col. Taylo,'' said Mrs. Aquino, whose husband Benigno wasslain in a political assassination in 1983.
``And I hope that this,perhaps, could be a reminder to all our people in the military andpolice that they should take necessary precautions to ward off theseassasination attempts.''
National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the killing of Tayloshowed that every soldier and policeman was a potential target ofassassination.
``I'm sure all the major unit commanders are doing theirbest not only to protect their men but to counter such acts.''
Despite the escalating violence, Mrs. Aquino said she still plansto go ahead with a visit to Western Europe this month.
Mrs. Aquino leaves Saturday for an official visit to WestGermany.
She will also visit France and Belgium before departingBrussels for home on July 15.

Introduction:L. Gordon Crovitz quotes Alexander Hamilton in "LawmakersSue for Their Jobs -- Another Reason for Term Limits" (Ruleof Law, June 19) to note that legislators sometimes takethemselves too seriously.
But is it true, as Mr. Crovitzimplies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms?Clearly not.
Federalists Hamilton and James Madison hadsome experience with term limits.
Hamilton, who did not even support term limitations on thepresidency, reasoned that imposing limits "would be adiminution of the inducements to good behavior."
Term limits would have cost us EverettDirksen, who rallied Republicans around early civil-rightsbills and Florida's own Claude Pepper, who long defendedSocial Security and Medicare against revenue raids.
It was not the Federalists but their adversaries whoclamored for term limits, perhaps because they were then outof power.

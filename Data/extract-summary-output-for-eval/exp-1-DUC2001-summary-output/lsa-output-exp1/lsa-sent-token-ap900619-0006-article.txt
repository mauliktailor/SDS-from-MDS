So far this year, 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide,well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first sixmonths of last year, and the 30-year average of 482 tornadoesrecorded between January and July, said Frederick Ostby of theNational Severe Storms Forecast Center here.
``We seem to be on a pace that would put us up with those twoyears,'' Ostby said.
Ostby said 101 tornadoes touched down from Kansas toKentucky, leaving nine people dead.
But a break in the storm pattern may be at hand.
As summer wears on, the land warms up and cold air from Canadaretreats.
``Our longer range computer forecasts are suggestive of that.
There is some kind of a readjustment beginning to take place in theupper atmosphere,'' he said.
The study of tornadoes since early this century shows that theyare concentrated in regions for five- or six-year periods, saidMichael Smith, president of WeatherData Inc.
But warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated,leading to fewer deaths.
Tornadoes have caused 20 deaths this year,while an average year in the 1980s saw 52 deaths, and in the 1970snearly 100, Ostby said.
Ostby credited the quicker response to computers that allowmeteorologists to see many sources of data, such as satellitereadings, more clearly.
Authorities held out little hope for more than adozen others listed as missing.
Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{inches of rain in 3{ hours.
Flooding in Texas has been blamed for at least 16 deaths sinceApril.

Introduction: A top West German military officialsaid Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S. Air Force jet thatkilled six people will further erode popular support for nationaldefense programs.
Seven people hurt in Thursday's accident remainedin critical condition, he said.
Rescue workers continued to comb thedebris Saturday, as work crews tore down the remains of demolishedhouses.
``We are in a very difficult psychological situation,'' DieterWellershoff was quoted as saying.
``I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hardfacts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace,''which hinge on West Germany's and NATO's security preparedness, hesaid.
Wellershoff's comments were to appear in the newspaper's Sundayeditions.
West Germany's skies are crowded with hundreds of jets andhelicopters each day.
Even before Thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents ofmilitary aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone.
Theyincluded 70 people who died as a result of an air show crash at theU.S.
Following the Remscheid crash, temporary suspensions of low-leveltraining missions were ordered.
The U.S. Air Force said in a statement Saturday that the pilot ofthe A-10 ``inadvertently flew into clouds'' while attempting to joinin close formation with another aircraft.
The Air Force statement, quoting Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson,said the pilot ``then initiated a separation maneuver as is normalif two aircraft in formation lose visual contact.''
``We do not know why,'' Anderson said in the statement.

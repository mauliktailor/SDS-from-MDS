Censusfigures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among thestates every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to localgovernments.
The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of Housemembers from states where slow growth threatens to result in lossesof House seats.
Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, Westand industrial states like New York, and other states fear a lossof power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
While aliens have been counted in the past, military personnelstationed overseas have not.
The Commerce Department settled that problem by announcing itwill work with the Defense Department on ways to count the 1.2million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers wholive overseas.
The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both incommittee and on the House floor.
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban oncounting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 millionto run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year,including $800 million to take the census.
The bill was approved258-165 and sent to the Senate.
The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget forthe census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegalaliens, he said.
Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really overpopulation shifts that will lead to more House seats for southernand western states.
``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go downto the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose aseat,'' said Dymally.
It may be constitutional, but it's just notright.''
Asking people about their status likely wouldresult in people lying or refusing to participate in the count,officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of residents inmany areas.

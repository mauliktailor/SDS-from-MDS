Introduction:Alphonce Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania, but who later fell prey to alcoholism, continues his comeback bid in Sunday's America's Finest City HomeFed Half Marathon.
The race is scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. at the Cabrillo Monument atop the Point Loma Peninsula.
The Goodwill Games victory came despite Swai's taking a wrong turn and running 150 yards in another direction before getting back on track.
He insists he'll need that kind of a time to beat a bevy of Mexican and African runners.
The women's field is led by Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash. Track &amp; Field News ranked Jones third among women marathoners in 1989 and first among U.S. competitors.
Also in 1989, Jones won the Twin Cities Marathon, placed second in Houston and third in Boston.
"It is a challenging course," Swai said.
"The runner who is smart and thinks through it will be the one who is going to win.
You can't just go out and run hard on this course."

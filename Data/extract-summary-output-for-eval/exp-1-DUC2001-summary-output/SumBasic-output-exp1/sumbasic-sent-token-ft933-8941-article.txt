The mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southernborder of Zimbabwe.
After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into productionas Venetia, one of the world's biggest diamond mines.
The government insists that all minerals are soldthrough its state-controlled Minerals Marketing Corporation.
)Mr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with DeBeers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience.
He helpedAuridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he wasonce chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put upfor tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5mtonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in Marchlast year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them ofgem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.
The increase will be reached in two phases.
The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy andmove a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZCorporation's diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.
A 28-carat stone was sold for Dollars 110,000 or Dollars 4,000 acarat, and one of 17 carats for Dollars 95,000 (Dollars 6,000 a carat).Diamonds are being sold directly to the market in Antwerp, Belgium, and notthrough De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 percent of the world rough (uncut) diamond trade.
But as Mr Baxter-Brownpointed out: '330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.

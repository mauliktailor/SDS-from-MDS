Introduction:Opponents of any sort of gun control write passionately,but, judging from their letters ("Smile When You Say GunControl," Jan. 14) , they don't read well.
For example, one letter writer, commenting on my Dec. 12Counterpoint, "Gun Control Is Constitutional," felt compelledto instruct me that the word militia means "the wholepeople," a point I quoted three times and also paraphrasedonce in my brief article.
He and the others who dwelt on thispoint also don't read the Second Amendment very well.
I said nothing like that.
Theserights are not denied just because the Constitution doesn'tmention them; and the rights are not disparaged by the factthat we must obtain a marriage license, driver's license or adog license.
All the letters missed entirely my point about requiringgun owners to "sign up" with (not "join") the National Guard.
Registering is verydifferent from enlisting for active service.
Requiring gunowners to register with the National Guard would provide thekind of scrutiny the Brady and Staggers bills contemplated,and, if Congress dared, could provide an additional measureof control over who owns what kinds of weapons.
Elbridge Gerry opposed James Madison'sclause exempting persons "religiously scrupulous," because ofthe danger that it might be abused to discriminate againstmembers of certain sects, "to declare who are those who arereligiously scrupulous," and then keep them out of themilitia.
The real issue is that the Second Amendment addressed aserious public concern, to protect the right of citizens toserve as defenders of the community in times of peril, notthe personal uses of guns.
Plain and simple, it is no barrier to sensible guncontrol.

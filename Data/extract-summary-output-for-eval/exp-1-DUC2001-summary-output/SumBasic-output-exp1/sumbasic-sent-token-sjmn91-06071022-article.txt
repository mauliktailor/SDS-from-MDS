Introduction: Foresters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past twoweeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer because theywill stimulate the growth of grasses.
While reluctant to predict fires because they dependnot just on drought but also on temperature and wind patterns, fire officialsare deeply worried.
"This year is shaping up to be the worst fire seasonwe've ever experienced," said Warner McGrew, assistant fire chief at SantaBarbara, where the drought is worst and where brush fires destroyed 600 homesand did $200 million damage last year.
The freeze killed the avocado andlemon orchards that used to serve as fire breaks, and McGrew said fire codesare being strictly enforced to compel homeowners to remove vegetation nearhouses.
"We are going to have quite a time trying to protect those structures," saidPaul H. Rippens, assistant chief for forestry at the Los Angeles County FireDepartment.
The department is clearing some areas by setting small firesthat are tightly controlled, the first of which recently burned off 335hillside acres in the Monte Nido area of Malibu.
Expand youth corpsGov.
Pete Wilson has proposed expanding the state's youth conservation corps toreplace the troops who traditionally have stepped in to help fight the worstWestern fires.
But it will be difficult to replace the C-130 planes thatare converted into air tankers to drop retardants onto flames, and themilitary helicopters with infrared sensing devices that peer through smoke.

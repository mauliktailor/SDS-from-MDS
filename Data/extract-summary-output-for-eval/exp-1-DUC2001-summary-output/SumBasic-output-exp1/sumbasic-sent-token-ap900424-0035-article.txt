Introduction: A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylorbattled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by aventilator, doctors say.
Analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take untilThursday, said her spokeswoman, Chen Sam.
The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for``Butterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' has beenhospitalized more than two weeks.
She was in the intensive careunit at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.
``It is serious, but they are really pleased with her progress.
She's not on her deathbed or anything,'' Ms. Samsaid late Monday.
While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator,it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G.Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert whoemphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.
Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restoreoxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathingdifficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said.
Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,particularly back troubles from filming of ``National Velvet' in1945, when she fell off a horse.
In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pillsand painkillers.
During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylorunderwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help herbreathe.
She appeared at the 1961 Academy Awards with a bandageover her scar as she accepted the ``Butterfield 8'' Oscar.

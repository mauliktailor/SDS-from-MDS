Introduction: Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz.
For Waitz, the result was different than anything she had experienced in New York.
The last American men's winner was Alberto Salazar in 1982, when he took the title for the third time.
Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., finished second among the women for the second consecutive year, five seconds behind Panfil to make it the closest finish in the race's 21-year history.
It was the slowest winning women's time since Waitz's 2:32:30 in 1978.
Sunday, the temperature got as high as 72 degrees and the humidity peaked at 66 percent.
Ken Martin of Dallas, the runner-up last year, failed to finish this time.
Bothered by a virus for the past two months, he dropped out after 19 miles.
The first American finisher was Gerry O'Hara, a 26-year-old New Yorker who was 29th in 2:26:15.
Mohamed Idris of Brooklyn, N.Y., who finished 22nd in 2:22:23, originally was announced as the top American, but race officials later determined he was an Egyptian citizen.
After staying with the lead pack for the first 20 miles, the cool, composed Wakiihuri took control and pulled away to a 40-second victory over Salvador Garcia of Mexico.
In only seven previous marathons, the 27-year-old Wakiihuri has won the '87 world championship, the '89 London Marathon in a personal-best 2:09:03 and the '90 Commonwealth Games marathon.

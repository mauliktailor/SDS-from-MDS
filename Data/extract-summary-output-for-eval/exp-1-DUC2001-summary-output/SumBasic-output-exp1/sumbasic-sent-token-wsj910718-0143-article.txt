But is it true, as Mr. Crovitzimplies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms?Clearly not.
Federalists Hamilton and James Madison hadsome experience with term limits.
Madison saidthat some members of Congress will "by frequent re-elections,become members of long-standing; will be thoroughly mastersof the public business.
"In fact, that has been the case.
To dictate andcontrol them, to tell them who they shall not elect, is toabridge their natural rights."T.K.

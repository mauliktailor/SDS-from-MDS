Later in the day in Juneau, a package of bills aimed at protecting Alaska from another devastating oil spill like the one that fouled Prince William Sound was passed by the state Senate with little trouble.
Unfortunately, it's impossible to completely remove the oil unless you steam-clean the tanker, and nobody intends to do that," Robbins said.
Robbins did not give an estimate of how widespread the oil sheen, or shininess on the water's surface, had become.
Time-Consuming Repairs He said he doubted the vessel, which is undergoing temporary repairs 30 miles from the March 24 site where the Exxon Valdez ruptured on a reef, will be moved soon.
"Obviously, this (ship) is a hot potato.
Nobody in the Lower 48 (states) wants it.
We may end up going to a foreign port."
Reacting to the largest oil spill in the nation's history, the Republican-led Senate acted with unusual speed to move the six bills through the chamber and to the House.
However, it appeared unlikely that the Democrat-controlled House would approve the entire package before adjournment, which is scheduled for May 9.
More Bills Pending More than a dozen other spill-related bills are still pending in both chambers of the Legislature.
Exxon reported Saturday that it has paid out $500,000 to 150 fishermen on claims of lost work.

``This is a fairness issue,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa.,who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliensbenefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extraseats in the House.
Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a Housemember another must lose one.
The result, he said, was that Georgiaand Indiana lost House seats to New York and California.
Subcommittee Chairman Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., however, saidhe is unsure whether the bills backed by Ridge and others areconstitutional.
The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to cound allthe ``persons'' in the country every 10 years for purposes ofreapportionment.
It doesn't specify citizens.
Noting that at times in the past blacks and Indians have beenexcluded from participation in government, he commented: ``I do notwant to return to a time when some human beings are considered lessthan equal in the eyes of the law.''
And Rep. Albert G. Bustamente, D-Texas, termed the worry overcounting aliens ``hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement ofAmericans into western and southern states has had a much largereffect on representation than the presence of aliens.
But Reps. Tom Petri, R-Wis. and William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basicright to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congressto states where the aliens live.

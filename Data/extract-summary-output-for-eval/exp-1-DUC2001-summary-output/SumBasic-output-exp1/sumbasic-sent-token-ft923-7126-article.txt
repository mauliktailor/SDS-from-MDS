In Canada's Northwest Territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, someof gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in thehistory of the North American industry.
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large andprospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) ofthe discovery.
In spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone willfind enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada's first diamondmine worthwhile.
An estimated 50,000 private-enterprise diggers are at work already and theirnumbers are being swelled by 500 a day.
Did Unita, Angola'srebel movement, build up a stockpile which is now being released?
IsEndiama, Angola's state-owned diamond company, implicated in some way?
Inthe murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound.
They arecomposed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes intough material, but there are substitutes for this use.
Gem diamonds aresolely for decoration and serve no useful purpose.
Apart from De Beers' own production from Namibia and South Africa, the CSOhandles rough gem diamonds from Angola, Australia, Botswana, Russia,Tanzania and Zaire.
The CSO has been mopping up as many of the smuggled Angolan diamonds aspossible to stop havoc being created in a business already sufferingseverely from soggy demand in the US and Japan, the two biggest markets,which share about two-thirds of demand between them.
De Beers says that, because times are tough.
it will probably have to cutits annual dividend payment for the first time since 1981.
It has also toldthe producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent - something the CSO contractspermit at times of stress.
Buyers have either to acceptall the diamonds or reject the box.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls both De Beers andits sister group, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, wasdefending the cartel again last week at the formal opening of the R1.1bnVenetia diamond mine in the Transvaal. '
The CSO does not, and could not, runa monopolistic system,' he said. '
In bad times like this, I sometimes wishthat we could.
The fact is that the level of world diamond production, whichis carried on in many countries, cannot be controlled.
Diamond prices cannotbe fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows productionand consumption to be equated.
'All very altruistic.
But De Beers makes huge profits from its diamondbusiness - a record Dollars 1.24bn in 1990 and more than Dollars 1bn lastyear.
The cartel nearly lost control of the market in the early 1980s.
Merchants, particularly in Israel, stockpiled diamonds on borrowed money asa hedge against inflation and when recession hit they had to dump diamondsfaster than the Central Selling Organisation could mop them up.
The CSO'sdiamond stocks, worth under Dollars 1bn in 1980 rose to Dollars 1.9bn by1984.
After the bust came boom.
To cool the market, theCSO imposed swingeing price increases: 13.5 per cent in May 1988 and 15.5per cent in March 1989.
Underlying the boom was phenomenal growth in demandfor diamonds in Japan where lack of living space encourages people todisplay their wealth by buying small but expensive items.
The CSO boostedthe trend with clever promotion so that today diamond engagement rings areregularly exchanged in Japan whereas forthcoming marriages traditionallywere celebrated over a cup of rice wine.
It must be open to question whether another Japan can be found to lift thediamond market as the present recession ends.
CDM, has diamond mining operations over a coastal areaextending 100 km north of the Orange River and recently brought the Auchasand Elizabeth Bay mines into production.
Last year Namibian output reached1.19m carats, up from 750,000.

As National Transportation Safety Board investigatorshurried to the scene, there weren't any early indications onwhy the jet might have crashed.
The plane hit theground several miles south of the airport at about 11:40 a.m. EST yesterday, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said.
The planewas traveling from Denver.
The crash comes at a particularly sensitive time for thetravel industry.
Most of the travelsector has resorted to sharp discounting to spark travel.
This, in fact, may have been one reason why the load onthe United flight was light.
In February 1989, the cargo door onUnited Boeing 747 burst open near Hawaii, tearing a gapinghole in the fuselage.
Nine passengers died.
About two hours before yesterday's crash, the NationalWeather Service in Colorado Springs issued its first highwind warning for the area since January, according to JamesHall, a meteorological technician observer in ColoradoSprings.
It's essentially like waterhitting rocks and splashing and foaming over.
"A Federal Aviation Administration official said, "Therewere some reports of gusting winds but whether or not thathad any impact or whether there was any kind of mechanicalproblem, I can't speculate.
If preliminary reports that there was windshear in the area are true, then "that would indicate therewas some instability in the atmosphere," he added.
Wind shear is a sudden, violent shift in wind direction.
It can smash an airplane into the ground.
However, he said that wind shear is most dangerous when anaircraft is flying at a very low altitude, either shortlybefore landing or right after takeoff.
No buildings or structures on the ground were damaged bythe crash, according to the El Paso County SheriffsDepartment.
United acquired the plane in June 1986.
The plane wasoperated by an engine manufactured by United TechnologiesCorp.

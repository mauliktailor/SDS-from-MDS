Introduction: The Senate today confirmed conservative civilrights official Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge,brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal andsenior citizens groups.
Thomas, 41, will be a judge on the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appealsin the District of Columbia.
Thomas, a critic of quotas and affirmative action to fighthiring discrimination, has been highly praised by conservatives.
It became clear Monday night that Thomas' critics had failed tomuster enough support to defeat his nomination.
``They might as well have been sent to Bulgaria.
It's too much to overlook.''
Pryor said, however, that Thomas was virtually guaranteed to winconfirmation and added that he wished the nominee well in his newpost.
``I hired him twice,'' Danforth said.
``People say, 'Don't youever make a mistake?'
Well, yeah, but not twice.''
Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., dismissed complaints that Thomas hadfailed to cooperate with the Aging Committee several years ago whenformer Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., was chairman.
Thomas was born in poverty in rural Georgia, worked his waythrough college and is a graduate of Yale Law School.
But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peopledid not take a stand on the issue.

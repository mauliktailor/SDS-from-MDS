On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales.
British officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of economic, not health, concerns.
The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the "mad cow" scare.
"It's totally unjustified and illegal," said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the Meat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization.
West Germany bought $50 million worth last year.
The cows become aggressive and then wobbly-legged before dying.
No one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow's brain.
Some experts believe that cattle contracted the disease as a result of eating food contaminated with the remains of sheep infected with a BSE-like disease called scrapie.
Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently.
On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died from a disease identical to BSE.
The press went wild with the story, suggesting, in boldface, that if cats can get it, people can too.
Panic ensued. "
Two thousand schools dropped beef from their menus.
Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef.

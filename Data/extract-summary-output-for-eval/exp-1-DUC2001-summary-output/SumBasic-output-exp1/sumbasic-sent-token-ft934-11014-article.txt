Introduction: THE US administration has given the go-ahead for pilot plans to reformwelfare benefits in Wisconsin and Georgia that could serve as experimentsfor the broader overhaul of the welfare system promised by President BillClinton.
In Georgia, the state does not plan a time limit on benefits, but wants toreduce welfare payments to able-bodied adults who refuse offers of work anddeny increases in payments to families on long-term welfare who have morechildren.
The promise to 'end welfare as we know it' was an important theme in MrClinton's election campaign.
Although he named a welfare reform task forcein June, the reform has been held up by delays in passing the budget and isnow expected to be delayed until the ambitious reform of the healthcaresystem has passed Congress.

For a timeVenetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission forseven-day working, moved to a five-day week.
It is alsomining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne.
Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will bewell below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield atfull production.
Mr Gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the CSO quota, Venetia'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production'.This year will be a time of consolidation.
He insists that the quota is having no impact on employment.
Nevertheless,Venetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764.
The total has beenkept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by 'fewerpeople employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs',according to Mr David Gadd-Claxton, ore extraction manager.
It isalso the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of exportearnings.
Venetia's success is strategically important to De Beers because, when itsoutput is added to that in Botswana and Namibia, it gives the group directcontrol over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output.
And, while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnesof waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labourrelations and environmental issues, at least as far as South Africa isconcerned.
For example, there are no migrant workers at the mine.
Employees are bussedin from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families.
Here worn out equipment will be stockpiledand sold off when the mine closes.

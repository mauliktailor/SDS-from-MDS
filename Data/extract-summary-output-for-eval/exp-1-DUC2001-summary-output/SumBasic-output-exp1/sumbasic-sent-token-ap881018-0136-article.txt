Introduction:   Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across theopen Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that hasforecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possiblelandfall.
There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead ormissing in a town in Colombia the day before.
``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist atthe National Hurricane Center.
``You just don't see many hurricanesthat take this course and hug the coast.''
At noon EDT today, Joan's center was near latitude 11.1 northand longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the Colombian coastand about 380 miles east of the island of San Andres off the coastof Nicaragua.
Panama issued a hurricane watch for its north coast, andColombia issued a hurricane watch for San Andres, which is part ofColombia even though it is located close to Nicaragua.
As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, Joan slowly built itsstrength as it skimmed Colombia's coast, baffling forecasters whohad predicted it to weaken.
Normally, prevailing windsand upper-level atmospheric conditions push tropical stormsnorthward as they move from the Atlantic, said Gross.
Gilbert, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, leftmore than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage asit tore through Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico's Yucatanpeninsula last month.
The six-month hurricane season ends Nov. 30.

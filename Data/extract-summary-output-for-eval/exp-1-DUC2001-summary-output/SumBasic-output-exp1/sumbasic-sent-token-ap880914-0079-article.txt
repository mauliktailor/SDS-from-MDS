Interest in Gilbert has been high since it started packinghurricane-force winds last weekend and by Tuesday night became aCategory 5 storm with winds of 175 mph.
Gilbert has been compared to the Labor Day hurricane of 1935,which slammed into the Florida Keys and killed 408 people, andHurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969,killing 256 _ the only other Category 5 storms to hit land thiscentury.
The center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricaneforecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch on thehurricane in a large, open roomful of blue monitors flickering withgraphics.
Dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealingwith smaller ones or tropical storms, Sheets said, adding thatGilbert has been particularly ``well-behaved.''
``You feela lot more confident about what you're doing than with weakersystems.''
His previous experience with hurricanes has served him well inkeeping off the pressure during these sometimes 18-hour days.
``I've done this for 25 years so at one stage you're prepared todo it or not.

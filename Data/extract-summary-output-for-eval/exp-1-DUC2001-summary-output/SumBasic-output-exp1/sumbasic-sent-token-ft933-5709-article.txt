Introduction: THE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help gethis free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience ininternational trade arenas.
Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother,45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator withimportant connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organisedlabour.
He has never run for political office.
Recentpolls show that as many as two-thirds of the American people do not supportNafta, and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing.
Many Democrats inCongress, including some in the powerful Illinois delegation, areuncommitted.
Mr Daley's talents have beensummoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back theagreement.
The president needs 218 votes in the House to ratify Nafta.
Theadministration counts 125 Republicans in favour of the agreement.
His Chicago-style back-room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to thepublic tactics of Nafta's most prominent opponent, Mr Ross Perot.
Mr Perot'spopulist anti-Nafta campaign touts the 'giant sucking sound' that will beheard as Nafta-loosened jobs flow south of the Texas border.
Bill Daley is like a Stealth bomber.
You maynot see him, but you'll see the results.
'Mr Daley has taken four months out from his Chicago law firm to lead theNafta push.
Although it passed into privateownership in 1966, its board is still dominated by high-profile unionofficials.
Mr Clinton may be banking on Mr Daley's union ties to help the Nafta effort.
It's just wrong.

Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance togrow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
``My guess is that the moratorium would be finished by thebeginning of the Western fire season, which is the middle of May,''Charles Philpot, co-chairman of the review panel, told a newsconference.
The panel was assembled last September after the worst fireseason ever in drought-primed Yellowstone National Park.
Some 249fires seared 706,278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percentas much again in nearby national forests.
Residents in the fire vicinity complained bitterly that the park,tourism and the very air they breathed were being ruined by thefailure to control the fires.
However,it did not consider policies in other areas such as ordinarynational forests, where the Forest Service tries to protectcommercial timbering operations.
The panel's report will remain open for public comment for 60days before any recommendations are adopted.
The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areasshould be allowed to burn until government fire management plans areimproved and strengthened.
Another recommendation called for the responsible agency officialto ``certify in writing daily that adequate resources are availableto ensure'' that every natural fire will be kept within boundariesset by government authorities.

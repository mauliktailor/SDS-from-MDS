Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control cited a surveyin 29 states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per100,000 inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000reported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during thesame period.
In New Jersey, inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987,11 times higher than the general New Jersey population.
As many as 7 percent of Americans havelatent TB infections, and about 10 percent of them will somedaydevelop a case of tuberculosis itself.
``Persons at highest risk ... are close contacts,'' the CDCsaid, noting that TB can pose particular problems in prisons, wherethere is often overcrowding and ``where the environment is oftenconducive to airborne transmission of infection among inmates,staff and visitors.''
The CDC committee also recommends new tests at least once ayear, rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms,and isolation _ off the prison property, if necessary _ for thosewith suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB cases.
The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in thespread of TB in prisons, the CDC said.
AIDS weakens the immunesystem, making patients susceptible to infections other peoplemight ward off, including tuberculosis.

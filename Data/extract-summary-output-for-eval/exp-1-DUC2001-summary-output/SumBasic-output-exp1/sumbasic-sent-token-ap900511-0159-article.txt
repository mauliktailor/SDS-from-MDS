Introduction:   Elizabeth Taylor sufferedcomplications including new infections in her fifth week ofhospitalization for pneumonia, and will remain hospitalized forabout six more weeks , doctors said Friday.
Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious thanthe viral pneumonia Miss Taylor initially contracted.
That'sbecause antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses.
``She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctorsare pleased with her progress,'' Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam,said after talking to doctors.
Hospital spokeswoman Paulette Weir said she couldn't go beyondthe statement.
During a news conference last month, Miss Taylor's doctorsrevealed she was near death on April 22.
Miss Taylor was reportedly in one of the hospital's suites.
Suites are ``like a small hotel room with a sitting room, aliving room area,'' Weir said without confirming whether theactress was in a suite.
Visitors throughout Miss Taylor's hospitalization included herfour children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopherand Michael Wilding.
Entertainer Michael Jackson also paid a visit.

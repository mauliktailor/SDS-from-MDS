Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blazethat raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park inCalifornia over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-dayfire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Mondayafter the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.
About a quarter-inch of rain helped to keep the lightning-causedShoshone fire's growth to about 200 acres overnight, said fireinformation officer Dave Damron.
But the nearly quarter-inch ofrain that fell Monday held it to 1,650 acres, he said.
The rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100-man patrolplanned for Monday night.
Crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air,Damron said, as four helicopters and three air tankers droppedchemical retardant and water on the spreading flames.
Meanwhile at Yellowstone, park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt saidthat because the three fires there all were in the backcountry, nofirefighters were trying to douse the flames.
Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity,reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon andhoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning,Hale said.
The fire was the largest so far this year in the forest, whichwas the scene of huge wildfires last summer.
``We'll continue to patrol the area to make sure wedidn't miss any hot spots.''
Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeksbefore the fire is extinguished.
Investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause.

Introduction:Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls.
Students of government like me find it hard to understand why.
Quite the contrary.
This will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it.
Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment.
People need time to learn their jobs.
New people in any complex institution are highly dependent on the people around them.
Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them.
Why do we assume that new blood is automatically better than old?
Finally, term limitations won't enhance representative democracy.
Why are we so certain that voters have such terrible judgment that they need a constitutional restriction keeping them from voting for incumbents they know and like?
One must conclude that other forces are at work.
They're probably right about that.

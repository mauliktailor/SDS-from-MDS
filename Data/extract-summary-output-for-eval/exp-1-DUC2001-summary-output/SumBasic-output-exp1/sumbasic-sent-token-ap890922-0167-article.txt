Introduction:   Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise ofseveral hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive pathHurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to fleethe South Carolina coast.
But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer modelsto track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.   ``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions andforecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in thosemodels,'' said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite service.
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, butforecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time forevacuation.
``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because wedon't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said.``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.''
The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minuteincrease in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Forcereconnaissance.
Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting toolswere reports from aircraft or ships.
``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say ourforecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said.
In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites toobtain a global weather picture.
To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.
``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanescomes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job,'' Emmanuel said.

Mr Richard Lopez, an aide to the congressional Hispanic caucus, said lastweek that differing opinion had prevented the group taking an officialposition on Nafta.
Leaders of important Hispanic coalitions such as La Raza, a civil rightsgroup, and the Southwest Voter Registration Project said they fearedHispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact of Nafta.
Trade would produce jobgrowth on both sides of the border, but the question is how those jobs aredistributed.
'Those sectors of the US economy most vulnerable to import penetration arethose sectors most dependent on recent immigration for their labour force.
'Fifteen Hispanic organisations, including La Raza, propose to set up atrilateral North American Development Bank to direct resources to regions ofthe US, Mexico and Canada most affected negatively by Nafta.
A vast majority of us(Hispanics) will be losers unless there are fundamental changes in thecurrent Nafta,' he said.

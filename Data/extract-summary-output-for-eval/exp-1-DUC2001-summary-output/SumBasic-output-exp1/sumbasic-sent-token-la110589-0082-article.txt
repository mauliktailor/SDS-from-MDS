And like California, Chile is still waiting for another "big one," an earthquake of magnitude 8 or more.
The frequency of earth movements prompts Chileans to say that every president has at least one major earthquake during the traditional six-year term in office.
Arze said after the 1985 earthquake, teams of foreign experts arrived in Chile to study the effects of the earthquake on buildings.
"Our buildings performed very well," he said.
Older buildings have been replaced over the years.
"We have so many earthquakes in Chile it has cleaned up our construction," Arze said.
Chilean earthquakes tend to be sharper and last longer than those of California, leading to differences in building design.
Chilean buildings are of reinforced concrete with more inside walls.
On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern Chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year's San Francisco quake.
Parts of the coast stretching south from the city of Concepcion, 325 miles south of Santiago, dropped nine feet.
"It was the biggest registered in the history of seismic instrumention," said Kausel.
About 5,000 people were killed in the sparsely populated area, most of them when the coastline dropped.
A tsunami, a tidal wave created by the earthquake, killed others and caused considerable damage in Japan and Hawaii.

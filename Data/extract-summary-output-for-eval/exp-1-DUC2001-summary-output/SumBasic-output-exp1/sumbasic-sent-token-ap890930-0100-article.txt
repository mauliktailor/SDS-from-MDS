Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by blackactivists that he would bring back the machine politics of his latefather, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 yearsbefore his death in 1976.
The younger Daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in hisspring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in theprimary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21Cabinet positions.
But now Daley finds himself on the defensive.
``It's the same stuff, and it's seemingly gettingworse.''
Daley is filling the remaining twoyears of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's firstblack mayor who was just a few months into his second term when hedied in November 1987.
``I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry inthe city of Chicago,'' Daley said.
``Everyone should join together... to help alleviate this problem.''
Also last week, a human relations task force made up of businessand civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago wasfueled by ``a shocking lack of contact'' between the city's ethnicgroups.
At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks whoalleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests,intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
Two teen-age boys testified that in August they were picked upby white officers, roughed up, and then dropped off in a whiteneighborhood where they were attacked by white youths.
``When this police department is attacked, I must defend it.

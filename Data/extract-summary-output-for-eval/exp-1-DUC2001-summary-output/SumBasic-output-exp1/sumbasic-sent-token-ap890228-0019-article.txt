Thedeath toll of 25,000 is the most recent reported by the Soviets.
The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by anearthquake.
Many of the deaths in Armenia were blamed on collapsingbuildings, as the earthquake rattled concrete structures until theyfell to the ground, according to subsequent analyses.
Another recent earthquake in the Soviet Union, claiming about1,000 lives, struck in Soviet central Asia.

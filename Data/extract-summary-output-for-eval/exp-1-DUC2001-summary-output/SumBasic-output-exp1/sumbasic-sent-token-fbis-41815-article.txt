Introduction: Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of "mad cow disease" affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought.
The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Of eight animals born in the herd since 1987, five have contracted the disease.
It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
In the United States, mink have been affected by it.
The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others.
Sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely.
Infected feed cannot account for four cases.
It is possible but unlikely that the mothers were carriers that passed on the infection without having symptoms themselves.
Another danger taken seriously by the zoo, a world centre for breeding rare and endangered species, is that animals bred in captivity could carry the infection when released into the wild.
If they proved as vulnerable as the kudu, this could be disastrous.
The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.

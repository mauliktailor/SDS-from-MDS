Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for theAtlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlierthought must be evacuated under certain conditions, said centerdirector Bob Sheets.
There are not enough shelters to handle the added load and thereare serious concerns how new glass-windowed high-rises would fareif lashed by hurricane-force winds during evacuations, he said.
During a hurricane that struck Houston, ``glass was flyingeverywhere,'' said Sheets.
He refused to make predictions about the 1988 hurricane season,saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predictthe number and severity of storms.
The first tropical depression of the year has formed, andremained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip ofCuba, or about 200 miles southwest of Havana.
The system containedwinds of up to 30 mph and was not expected to strengthen.
If that satellite does stop working, GOES-East would have to bedirected to move from its equatorial orbit over Brazil to a spotsouth of the Texas Gulf Coast, where it would provide a view of theWestern Hemisphere with limited vision in the hurricane-spawningeastern Atlantic, he said.
A typical Atlantic hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30, has10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained windexceeding 39 mph, six of which become hurricanes with drenchingrain and wind over 74 mph, Case said.
In 1987 there were only three hurricanes and four tropicalstorms in the Atlantic.
Hurricane Floyd hit Key West with 75 mphwind but fizzled out over the Everglades and Miami in mid-October.
Here are the names to be given to Atlantic tropical storms thatcould grow into hurricanes this season:   Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gilbert,Helene, Isaac, Joan, Keith, Leslie, Michael, Nadine, Oscar, Patty,Rafael, Sandy, Tony, Valerie and William.

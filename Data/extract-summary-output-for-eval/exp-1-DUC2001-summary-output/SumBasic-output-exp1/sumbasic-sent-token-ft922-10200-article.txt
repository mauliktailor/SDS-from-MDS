Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed bythe scale of the violence.
Police could only look on, outnumbered, as crowdslooted shops, and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack.
Shortly after his appointment in 1978, Mr Gates told a Hispanic audiencethat Hispanic officers were not promoted because they were lazy, and helater suggested that the carotid choke hold - a police technique severelycurbed in 1983 after police had killed 16 suspects with it - might be moredangerous for blacks because their arteries did not open up as fast as on'normal people'.In March, Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led aninvestigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angelespolice officer, although a judge had just released the two men wrongfullyconvicted, calling police conduct 'reprehensible' and urging an immediateinvestigation of the 'sordid record'.The detective involved now heads the unit which investigates shootingsinvolving police officers.
But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removalunder a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and MrGates has developed political clout on top of this job security.
Six months after its initial report, however, the commission noted that ofthe 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutalitycomplaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from fieldduty.
His replacement, Mr WillieWilliams, will be the first black head of the Los Angeles force.
Mr Williams faces an uphill struggle, but he has drawn widespread praise asPhiladelphia's police commissioner since 1988 for mending fences between thepolice and the community - notably through the use of the foot patrolmethods recommended by the Christopher commission.

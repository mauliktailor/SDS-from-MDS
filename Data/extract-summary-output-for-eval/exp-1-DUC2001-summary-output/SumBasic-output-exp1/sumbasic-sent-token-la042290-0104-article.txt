The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
"I think everyone agrees that the risks are low," says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London.
"But they certainly are not zero.
I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder."
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed.
In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE.
The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said.
"In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented."
As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months.
The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease.
But the report added: "If our assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect, the implications would be extremely serious."
There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last year.

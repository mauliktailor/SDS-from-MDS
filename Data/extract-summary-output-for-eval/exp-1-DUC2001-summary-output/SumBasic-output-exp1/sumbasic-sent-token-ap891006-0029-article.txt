Introduction:   Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knockedoff track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids,says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.
Watching Johnson was his chief nemesis: Carl Lewis, the man whowas awarded the Olympic gold medals Johnson lost.
``I think it's great,'' Lewis said of the legislation.
``They'remaking a move and it's very positive.
However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: ``Idon't understand why Ben Johnson's here.''
He said he didn't intend to upstage Johnson.
Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and BenjaminGilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented thelegislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlledsubstance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids bycollege, high school and even junior high school athletes whobelieve the substance will enhance their performance.
``America is about to have an adolescent time-bomb explode inits hands,'' Levine said.
``But if we act quickly enough torestrict steroid distribution, and to increase the penalties forillicit distribution, we can prevent this plague from spreading.''
Levine referred to the abuse of steroids as ``the silent side ofthe drug disease in this country.''
He applauded Johnson's couragefor attending the news conference.

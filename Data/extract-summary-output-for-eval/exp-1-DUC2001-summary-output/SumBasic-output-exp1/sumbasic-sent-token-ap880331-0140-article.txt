Introduction: Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced thebeginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from Aprilthrough June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in thenation's heartland.
More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June,records show.
In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoesoccur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the mostunstable, that average increases to about 36.
A tornado that touched down Tuesdayin central Louisiana, near Bunkie, destroyed two brick homes.
Ifthey wait until it gets there, it's going to be too late,'' saidBuddy McIntyre, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.
``A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm.
No matter howmuch preparation you do there is some property damage and some lossof life.
But there are some things you can do to protect yourselfand property,'' said Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for thegovernor's division of emergency management.
A tornado warning means one has already developed and has beenspotted.
Take cover immediately and don't go outside, but if youare in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in thenearest ditch or depression.
James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for DisasterResearch at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly tryto outrun tornadoes in their cars.
Twenty-six people died while trying to outrun the twister.
Another misconception is about opening windows.
It was oncebelieved that windows needed to be open to equalize air pressurebetween the storm and the inside of a house to prevent the housefrom exploding.

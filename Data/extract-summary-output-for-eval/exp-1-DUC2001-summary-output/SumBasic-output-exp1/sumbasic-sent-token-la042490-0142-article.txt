"She is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further determine the cause of her pneumonia," the physicians' statement said.
"After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator. "
We're not talking about anything terminal."
Taking a biopsy on the actress is called Sutton's law in medicine, after legendary holdup man Willie (the Actor) Sutton who said he robbed banks "because that's where the money is," said Dr. John G. Mohler, a pulmonary disease specialist at the USC School of Medicine.
"The problem is not easily found another way.
"You study the biopsy because that will dictate your therapy.
Emphasizing that he has no personal familiarity with the actress's case, Mohler said he does not "blame her doctors for being conservative.
Placing her on a ventilator would be a prudent and conservative thing to do, even if she didn't have any difficulty.
It may just be a precautionary step in this case."
Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey on April 10 suffering what her publicist then described as a "severe sinus infection. "
She was transferred to St. John's April 16 when her condition worsened.
Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist, said in a statement last week that Taylor had pneumonia and was "being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized (indefinitely). "
Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly recurring back troubles that began with a fall from a horse during filming of the 1945 movie "National Velvet."
Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse problems at the Betty Ford Clinic.

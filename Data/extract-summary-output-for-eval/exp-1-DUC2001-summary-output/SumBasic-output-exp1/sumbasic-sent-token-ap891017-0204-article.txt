Introduction: The major earthquake that struck the SanFrancisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologiststargeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake inNorthern California.
A 1988 report by the U.S. Geological Survey placed theprobability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scaleat 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.
``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake.
He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of LargeEarthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,''presented information that was already widely known amongscientists.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded onseismographs.
A reading of 6 can cause severe damage.
A quake of 7magnitude, a ``major'' earthquake, is capable of widespread heavydamage.
Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday'squake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.
It's something we should therefore be readyfor,'' Allen said.
``What will be important is to seehow the modern structures behaved.''
Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures thatappeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in theLos Angeles region.
In addition, some of the roadways andoverpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of constructionas the Bay Bridge.

Introduction: Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson.
This israther a burden to put on any man or woman but it isinevitable in his case because he is young, gifted and blackand now the center of one great row.
Some say that he is living proof that in America anything ispossible, and that's true, and some note his rise to eminencedemonstrates again the progress we have made as a nation interms of race, and that's true too.
His mother loved him.
And when she could no longer care forhim she gave him to her parents to bring up, and they lovedhim too.
He got loveand love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that hehad a place at the table.
This is something we in the age ofthe-family-that-is-not-a-family forget: the raw power of loveand how it is the one essential element in the creation offunctioning and successful people, and how its absence twiststhe psyche and the heart.
(The children of the mother oncrack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and painbecause AFDC payments are low; they are so consigned becausecrack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caringand succor.)

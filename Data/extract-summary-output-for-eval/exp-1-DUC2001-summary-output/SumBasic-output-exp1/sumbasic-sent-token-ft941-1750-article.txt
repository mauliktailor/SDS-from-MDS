Introduction: Central American and Caribbean governments are awaiting with more thanpassing interest an imminent US statement on measures to cushion theeconomic dislocation which the region expects from the North American FreeTrade Agreement.
However, Washington's proposals, promised by Mr Alexander Watson, assistantsecretary of state for inter-American affairs, are likely to disappointCaribbean basin governments which have been seeking a comprehensive packageto allow free access to the US and Canadian markets.
During this time they would havethe opportunity of negotiating their future trade relationship with theNafta signatories, with the option of seeking membership either asindividual states or as a group.
'President Clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefitsof Nafta are felt by the Caribbean countries,' said Mr Manuel Esquivel,prime minister of Belize. '
We are heartened by President Salinas' assurancesthat it is not Mexico's intention to take investments away from theCaribbean.
While willing togive parity to a few products, the US wanted the Caribbean basin countriesto meet new conditions, including bilateral investment treaties,intellectual property rights agreements, workers' rights and environmentallegislation, democracy, good governance and accountability, Mr Carringtonsaid.
'Each Dollars 1bn of US exports to the region creates 20,000 new jobs in theUS,' he said. '
In the past 10 years US exports to the Caribbean basin havedoubled, making the region the tenth largest market for US exporters.
This is why we must pursue efforts to ensure that thequestion of the granting of parity be given early and positiveconsideration.
The benefits from these were diminishing, said Mr Carrington, as theregion's exports became less competitive and Mexican products enjoyed thebenefits of the market.
'Nobody is going to give us an even playing field, but we have to work tomake it less uneven.

Introduction: The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season had more stormsthan usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of morefrequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years.
But this year's batch did not include the devastating storms ofyears past and at least one forecaster thinks 1991 will be a calmeryear.
In 1988 and 1989, there was near normal rainfall in the Sahel,the semi-arid land on the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert.
Gray on Thursday predicted a below-average hurricane season in1991.
``We've been through a real long period of hurricane inactivityin the '70s and '80s up until 1985, and I think we're coming out ofthat,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Centerin Coral Gables.
``Perhaps the Gilberts and the Hugos were signaling that ,'' hesaid, recalling Hurricane Gilbert that wracked the Caribbean andHurricane Hugo that devastated South Carolina - two of the mostdestructive Atlantic hurricanes ever.
Usually only a couple of those storms strikethe U.S.
The most deadly storm was Hurricane Diana, which swept intoMexico in early August, resulting in flash floods and mudslidesthat killed 96 people and caused extensive damage to roads,property and agriculture, the weather service reported.
A weather disturbance becomes a tropical storm, and is given aname, if its sustained winds reach 39 mph.
Storms become hurricanesif winds reach 74 mph.

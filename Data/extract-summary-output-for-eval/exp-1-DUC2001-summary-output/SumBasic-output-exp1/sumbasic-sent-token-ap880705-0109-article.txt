Introduction:   Firefighters in California, Michigan, Montana, Wyoming and Utahbattled holiday weekend fires which blackened more than 6,000 acresof forest and wilderness areas.
Illegal fireworks were blamed for a blaze that swept over 2,200rugged acres of Stanislaus National Forest in California, 10 mileswest of Yosemite National Park.
The fire was the largest in the forest this year.
However, on Sunday, winds ranging from 30 mph to 60 mph fannedthe flames out of control, Chief Ranger Bob Andrew said.
Firefighters, assisted by water-carrying aircraft, expected to havethe blaze contained by midday.
``It's been real quiet out there,'' Sgt.
Terry Leisening of theDelta County Sheriff's Department said today.
``I think they've gotit just about out.''
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dale Bluedorn agreed, but saidthey will continue to keep patrolling.
``It may not be declared outuntil there's a three-day rain,'' he said Monday.
A small contingent of firefighters who hiked into theAbsaroka-Beartooth Wilderness on Monday in south-central Montanacontained portions of a 2,000-acre fire that has been burning theresince June 19, forest officials said.
Forest Service policy allows wilderness fires to burn unlessthey threaten trails or structures, or threaten to burn outside thewilderness boundary.
Highwinds Saturday tripled the fire's size.

Introduction: A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer inthe Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas,but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threatenpopulated areas.
The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of thelast six hurricane seasons.
Those years brought just two to fivehurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.
The hurricane season officially begins June 1, and its mostactive period usually begins Aug. 1.
Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annualhurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his firstformal 1988 forecast in late May.
Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterlywinds at the equator and the approaching end of ``El Nino'' period.
Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actuallyoccurred.
Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantichurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said.
That pattern eventually will change, he said, ``but it isimpossible to say when this shift will occur.''

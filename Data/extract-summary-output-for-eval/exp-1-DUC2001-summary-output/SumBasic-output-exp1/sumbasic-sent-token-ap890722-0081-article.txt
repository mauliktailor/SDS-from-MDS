Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Stephen L. Perkins onFriday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felonagainst Edward Brown of Cumberland.
Prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did notintend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing inthe amendment indicated such an intent.
Attorney General James E. Tierney said Saturday that the casewould be appealed, adding, ``With all due respect to JusticePerkins, we think he is wrong.''
The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep andbear arms ``for the common defense.''
In response, theLegislature enacted a constitutional amendment deleting thatlanguage, and voters approved it in November 1987.
He previously had beenconvicted under the state's habitual offender law for operating amotor vehicle after his driver's license had been revoked.
Perkins denied a motion to dismiss the criminal threateningcharge, but threw out the gun possession charge, saying ``there issimply no rational connection'' between Brown's previous convictionand his ownership of a firearm.

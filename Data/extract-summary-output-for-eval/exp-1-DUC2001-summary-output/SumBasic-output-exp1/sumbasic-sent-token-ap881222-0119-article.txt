Introduction: Some of this year's drought in the Midwest mayhave been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equatorin the Pacific Ocean, according to a new computer study reportedThursday.
``Such an answer is, however, just a brief description of theweather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at thecause.
A more satisfying response would address why the jet streamwas displaced northward,'' the team wrote.
By July the weather patternthey studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the studyarea and elsewhere probably had other causes, Arkin said.
But during the April-June period there were alternating high andlow pressure centers across much of the northern half of the WesternHemisphere: A high-pressure center north of Hawaii, a low in theGulf of Alaska, a high in central Canada extending down into thenorthern Great Plains states and a low on the East Coast.
At the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surfacetemperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal.
The below-normal equatorial temperature by itself didnot give such a result.
``We haven't proved anything; all we've done is shown that it's apossibility,'' Arkin said.
The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running ofa more detailed computer model would be needed to show that theseabnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, hesaid.
The authors took note of computer models predicting increasedfrequency of drought with the buildup of the ``greenhouse effect''global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxidein the atmosphere.

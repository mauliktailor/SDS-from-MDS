The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslemfundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of itssecond-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub.
The death toll from the attack rose to six today with the deathof the speaker's chauffeur.
Doctors in a Cairo hospital said thedriver suffered bullet wounds in the stomach, back and arm.
They also lined the funeral processionroute, as did hundreds of plainclothes security men.
They included relativesof the dead, government officials and foreign diplomats.
Symbolic units from the military services spearheaded theprocession, followed by a military band and two dozenwreath-bearers.
A caisson bearing el-Mahgoub's coffin followed, also wrapped inthe flag.
It was drawn by three pairs of black horses.
Immediately behindcame two officers carrying el-Mahgoub's decorations laid onblack-velvet cushions.
The procession began from the mosque and stopped about 1,500feet away.
Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa had warned days earlier ofsuch an attack.
The state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram, quoting police sources,reported Monday that local Moslem extremists were collaboratingwith Palestinian terrorists sent to the country by Iraq on sabotagemissions.
Recent reports said Abu Nidal'sFatah-Revolutionary Council recently moved its headquarters fromLibya to Iraq.
El-Mahgoub's authority extended solely over the 458-seatParliament, which he had headed since 1984.

``We certainly deplore these kinds of terrorist activities andassassination is the most vile kind of terrorism.
We don't have anyindication at this time who was responsible or what their purposeswere,'' he said.

The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expectedto diminish.
A 30-day weather forecast issued Wednesday held little hope forimprovement.
And a separate climate assessment added that manyareas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percentchance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation wasundergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.
The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloudover that assumption.
The drought has been accompanied by higher than normaltemperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the westernGreat Lakes region.
However, in the Midwest, theweather service reported that large areas have experienced thedriest April-June period on record since 1895.
Recent rains have resulted in local flooding in Texas, butnationally streamflows are below normal, and even in Texas areexpected to fall back to below average levels.
Flows in many majorrivers remain low and continue to restrict navigation.
In addition to Thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-rangeoutlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remainhotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lowerMidwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies andGreat Basin.
Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward fromTexas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.

``This is just a normal day,'' said Waverly Person, chief of theU.S.
Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.``We're not backing the prediction at all.''
Browning said there was a 50-50 chance for a major earthquakeearly this week along the fault, which stretches from Marked Tree,Ark., northeast through New Marid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill.
``There are no two earthquakes alike.''
The center received more than 50 calls about the New Madridforecast Monday morning and hundreds last week, said Person, whobegan doing interviews for radio and television stations just aftermidnight.
As Person talked, 24 seismographs etched out activity recordedby monitoring equipment in different parts of the United States,ranging from Alaska to Tennessee.
That's wherethey conduct those tests.''
A few minutes later, the needle jumped again.
``That's not atest,'' he said.
``That's a quake.''
Quick calculations showed the quake wasmagnitude 3.5, centered about 30 miles southwest of Ely, Nev.
Between midnight and evening, four moderate quakes were recordedat Golden.
Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shakernear New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga.
A quake of magnitude 2 is about the smallest felt byhumans.
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,6 severe damage.
Some people watch precursor activity, but that doesn't alwayslead to an earthquake.
Over the years, he has heard countless earthquake predictions.

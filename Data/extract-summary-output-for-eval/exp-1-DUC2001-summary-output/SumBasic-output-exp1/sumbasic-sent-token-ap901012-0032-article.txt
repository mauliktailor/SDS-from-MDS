He said Air Force officials wanted to ``examine potentialhazards and to be sure they were doing everything possible toprevent accidents.
At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the number of U.S.aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashesthis week - were not out of the ordinary.
However, suspension oftraining flights indicated otherwise.
Williams said the Air Force gave its pilots in the gulf ``safetyawareness'' briefings during the flight ban in order ``to reviewwhat they need to do to fly more safely.''
Aircraft on operational missions were not grounded, said Col.Miguel Monteverde, another Pentagon spokesman.
Those includedreconnaissance aircraft, refueling tanker planes and F-15 jetspatrolling areas near the Kuwait or Iraqi borders.
He said pilotsof those planes received special safety briefings but their flightschedules were not changed.
Desert Shield, the largest U.S. military buildup since theVietnam War, involves an estimated 700 Air Force combat and supportaircraft.
The toll for accidental deaths since Operation Desert Shieldbegan rose to 31 on Wednesday when an Air Force F-111fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in Saudi Arabia,killing both crew members.
``They're concerned about the accidents, they're concerned aboutthe number of accidents that happened so quickly over a shortperiod of time,'' he told reporters.
``Given the amount of flying that has to be done, given theextraordinary circumstances and given the higher than ordinaryoperating tempo in the area, I think our service people are doingvery well, but any accident is cause for concern,'' he said.
Five U.S. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in thegulf area since the start of Desert Shield two months ago: anF-111, an F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet, an F-15E and two MarineCorps UH-1 Huey helicopters.
Also, a C-5 transport plane crashed inWest Germany while ferrying equipment to Saudi Arabia.

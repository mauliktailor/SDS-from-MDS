But the29-year-old Canadian, whose indoor and outdoor world records were washed awayby admissions that he used performance-enhancing substances for seven years,managed only to finish second in the 50-meter dash of the Hamilton SpectatorGames.
His time of 5.77 seconds was eclipsed by the 5.75-second time of DaronCouncil, a former narcotics officer who now works in crime prevention for theAlachua County, Fla., sheriff's department.
He would merely have been a gold medalist if a positive test at the1988 Olympics had not turned him into the most vilified champion in thehistory of the Games.
"I got caught in the blocks," Johnson said.
By then, thestart had been delayed eight minutes by two false starts and a problem withthe board track.
"It was Johnson's first indoor loss in11 meets dating to February 1987.
His time was far from the 5.55 he ran in1987 that is still listed as the fastest ever at 50 meters.
Size doesn't matter.
It's how fast you run .
"When he was introduced before the race, Johnson was given athunderous standing ovation.
Banners welcoming him back were drapedaround the arena.
"Another said, "Go Ben Go!"
and a third read, "Burn Rubber, Ben."

``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducingremission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber CancerInstitute in Boston.
A number of treatments for AIDSand AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many ofthem are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
``It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliverand require monitoring,'' Haseltine said.
But that has changed.``There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,''Mullins said.
Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses haveshown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believethat similar vaccines can be found for humans.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
In New York City, for example, tuberculosis declined between1960 and 1977, but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 levelagain.
``We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades ofprogress in our tuberculosis control efforts,'' said Vermund.
Andunlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casualcontact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air.
``It's likely to be yet another health problem imposed on theinner cities, where the health problems are already legion,''Vermund said.
He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic,probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the1970s.
Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis,Vermund said.

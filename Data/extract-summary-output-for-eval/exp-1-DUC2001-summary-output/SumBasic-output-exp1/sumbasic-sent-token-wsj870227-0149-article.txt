Moynihan and Kennedy.
Meeting this week in Washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system.
Those who do would be eligible for help with education and training, day care and transportation.
Many states already have launched work-for-welfare experiments.
The results in Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Utah have been promising.
These successes have encouraged the governors of New York, New Jersey, Washington and Missouri to undertake their own reform programs.
The conference's chairman, Democratic Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the White House meeting, "I feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than I did yesterday. "
That is not to say the president agreed with the governors on every count.
The governors argue that by spending the extra $2 billion a year, the federal government would be making an investment.
After all, Americans have spent more than $1 trillion over the past two decades to alleviate poverty and curb dependency without seeing evidence of an appreciable return on their substantial investment.
Oversold political programs and promises are largely what got us into this mess.
Nonetheless there is merit in the governors' plan, as there is in the administration's reform proposals, and in the reform bills under consideration in the Senate.
Most important, the governors would require that welfare recipients do something productive in exchange for their benefits, be it completing school, receiving vocational training or holding a job.
Only by requiring individual initiative and productivity can welfare recipients ever achieve self-sufficiency.
Since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action.

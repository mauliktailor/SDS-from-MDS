Introduction: The 1990 Atlantic hurricane seasonbegins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East andGulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a newera of destructive storms.
Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, areill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center.
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportpredicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine toTexas will grow 60 percent, counting from 1960 until 2010.
Somestates such as Florida and Texas will experience near 200 percentgrowth during the period, the report said.
``We can't stopthe hurricanes.
The only thing we can do is work on betterpreparedness and emergency planning.''
Hugo killed 28 people in the easternCaribbean and 29 more in South Carolina and caused a record $10billion in damage.
Hurricane activity started dropping after drought conditionsbegan in the early 1960s in Africa's Sahel region, he said.
There are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from Category 1,which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to Category 5,with top winds greater then 155 mph.
Sheets praised most South Carolina officials' response to Hugo,but said some leaders ``didn't have their proverbial act together''and lives may have been saved.
In the Caribbean, officials have worked to improve communicationssystems after links were cut by Gilbert.

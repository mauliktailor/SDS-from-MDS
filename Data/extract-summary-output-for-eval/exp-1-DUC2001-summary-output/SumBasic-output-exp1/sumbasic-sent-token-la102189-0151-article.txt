Agency officials said that if illegal aliens were to be excluded from the count, it would mean that, on paper, the county had 200,000 fewer residents than the county's actual population.
In a letter to the supervisors, Larry Leaman, director of the agency, urged the board to adopt the resolution supporting a complete count of all county residents and opposing "all attempts to systematically exclude any groups from the census."
Such exclusions, the letter said, could result in the county losing representatives in Congress because districts are determined by population.
Just Thursday, efforts to include illegal aliens in the Census received a major boost when negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House agreed on the issue.
The agreement worked out Thursday at the House-Senate conference will go back to each body before it is sent to President Bush, but it is considered likely to be approved.
In 1985, before the Federal Immigration Reform Act, the number of illegal aliens in the county was estimated at 300,000.
In Santa Ana, home to 44.5% of the county's Latinos, city officials worried about the ramifications of undercounting its residents.
If those residents had been included, it could have meant another $2.2 million in state and federal revenue, according to city officials.

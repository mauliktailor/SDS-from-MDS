Introduction:While more than a thousand runners were treated to an evening of comedy, music and magic at Saturday night's carbo load dinner on Mission Bay, Ernesto Beatriz Martinez of Mexico City was treated to a bumpy 12 1/2-hour bus ride from his hometown to border town Tijuana.
His recovery was simply amazing.
I was well prepared."
It was the first marathon Rollins has completed this year, after dropping out of the New York City Marathon four weeks ago in mile 18 because of stomach cramps.
Indeed it did.
This was a man who earlier this week was running in tattered shoes and had a TV raffled in his honor to raise the $180 required to cover transportation, the entrance fee and other expenses.
"My family, they are very poor."
Plaatjes and Ireland took home $2,500 each, and Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06) of Naucalpan, Mexico, the men's third place finisher, and Great Britian's Gillian Horovitz (2:43:20), now of New York City, third in the women's race, received $1,500.
Doug Kurtis of Detroit was successful in his bid to run his 12th marathon in a calendar year under 2 hours, 20 minutes.
His 2:18:16 finish set a world record.
"I traveled too much to get here to go home and say I went the wrong way," Castillo said, also using an interpreter.
We saw them way ahead of us," said Plaatjes.
"I told them (Bustos, LeDoux and Martin) not to worry about me, I'm not racing, but they better go catch the other guys.
Said Burke: "My position is that he paid the same fee, he ran the same race and he finished the race."
Although the city didn't allow any vehicles on the course from miles 18-22, Burke said cameras would verify that he did cover the complete distance.
But Beatriz Martinez took the lead at 23 miles and Plaatjes couldn't close the gap.

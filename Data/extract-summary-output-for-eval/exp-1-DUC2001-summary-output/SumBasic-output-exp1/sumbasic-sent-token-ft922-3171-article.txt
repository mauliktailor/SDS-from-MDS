Introduction:JUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreementseemed assured.
But the outpouring of public disaffection for 'politics as usual' has pushedto the forefront of many polls in the US election campaign Mr Ross Perot,the Texas billionaire.
His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congressto vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Naftaapproved by Congress this year.
Between retirements and election defeats,one-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foreseethe prevailing sentiment on trade issues.
'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if theydon't send a complete package in these three areas, the CongressionalDemocrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn'tmatter,' said Mr Freeman.
Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared itsground well in the House.
It now has 200 signatories to a resolution,introduced by Congressman Henry Waxman and majority leader Richard Gephardt,which warns that they will not support a Nafta that does not have strongenvironment or food safety provisions.
Fifty-seven of the 200 signatoriesvoted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over onthe issue.

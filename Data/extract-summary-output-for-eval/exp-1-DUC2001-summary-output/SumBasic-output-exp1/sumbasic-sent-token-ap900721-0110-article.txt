The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening,when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weatherwith a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. Sunday (9:03p.m.
EDT Saturday).
After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon willmove away, uncovering more and more of the sun.
The eclipse ends at5:45 a.m. in Helsinki.
About 10,000 people _ including 3,000 foreigners _ haveconverged on Joensuu, about 50 miles from the Soviet border.
Thereconditions there are considered especially good for viewing theeclipse _ weather permitting.
The sun comes upunusually late during winter.
But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated theinterest in the event.
``We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we madefor this event, and our extra stock is finished too,'' she said ina television interview Saturday.
Some eclipse viewers won't have to worry about the clouds,because they will be above them.
Finnair, the national airline, hasarranged a dozen special flights for eclipse watchers, and privatecompanies with small planes will provide more.
However, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than inlonger eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen fromnorthern Kenya on June 30, 1973.

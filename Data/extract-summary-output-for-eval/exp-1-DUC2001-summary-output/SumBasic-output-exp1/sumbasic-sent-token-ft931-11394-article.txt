Introduction:PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within thenext 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes.
The president said he would focus on better implementation of the FamilySupport Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-forcewhich he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala, new secretary ofhealth and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfarereform in a five-page statement of goals.
As a result, fewstates have been able to implement in full the act's requirement thatwelfare recipients take part in some form of education or training.
There must be'a certain time beyond which people don't draw a cheque for doing nothing,'he said.
Mr Clinton said he would let states experimentwith such programmes, even when he disagreed with them.

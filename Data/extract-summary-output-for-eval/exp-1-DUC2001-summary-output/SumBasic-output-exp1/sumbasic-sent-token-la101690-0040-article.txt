Introduction: Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday.
WHO attributed the sharp rise in part to the growing AIDS epidemic.
It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis.
These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people had thought that tuberculosis had gone away," said Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor of microbiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and a consultant to the United Nations.
About half of these are infectious.
Also, an estimated 1.7 billion individuals worldwide carry the organism but are not infectious to others.
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's immune system.
But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect numerous others.
You don't have to have a depressed immune system to get tuberculosis."
In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic.
At that time, they noticed a startling and unexpected drop in the rate of decline of tuberculosis cases.
This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases.
The overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per 100,000 population, he said.
However, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and compliance is a major problem.
The drugs must be taken for the entire six months to eliminate the infection.

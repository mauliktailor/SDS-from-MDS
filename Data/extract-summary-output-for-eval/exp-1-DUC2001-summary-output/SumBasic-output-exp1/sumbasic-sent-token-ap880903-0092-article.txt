Introduction: President Reagan warned Saturdaythat he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him thatdoes not contain a work requirement.
``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president saidin a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20miles north of here.
Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of hisadministration's economic record, saying Friday's unemploymentfigures showed that the jobless rate ``hovered just above thelowest it's been in 14 years.''
To deal with this, he said, his administration launched aprogram encouraging states to come up with their own plans to getpeople off the welfare rolls.
A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it aSenate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and aHouse-approved measure that does not.
``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,''the president said.
Downey said that while more people than ever before are working,``the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better offtoday than he or she was 10 years ago; in fact things have gottenworse.''
The poorest 40 percent of American families, with incomesadjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 yearsago; the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decadeago; and 32.5 million Americans remain mired in poverty, he said.
``Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary,but those requirements should be controlled by state and localofficials who administer our welfare programs, not federalbureaucrats,'' Downey said.

In the city of Remscheid, fire brigade leader Berthold Hoehlersaid the body of a construction worker was pulled from the rubble ofa house destroyed in the accident, raisng the death toll from theaccident to six.
Seven people hurt in Thursday's accident remainedin critical condition, he said.
Rescue workers continued to comb thedebris Saturday, as work crews tore down the remains of demolishedhouses.
``We are in a very difficult psychological situation,'' DieterWellershoff was quoted as saying.
Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindlingpublic support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfactionover disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers.
``I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hardfacts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace,''which hinge on West Germany's and NATO's security preparedness, hesaid.
West Germany's skies are crowded with hundreds of jets andhelicopters each day.
Even before Thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents ofmilitary aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone.
Theyincluded 70 people who died as a result of an air show crash at theU.S.
Following the Remscheid crash, temporary suspensions of low-leveltraining missions were ordered.
The Air Force statement, quoting Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson,said the pilot ``then initiated a separation maneuver as is normalif two aircraft in formation lose visual contact.''
The statement said the lead aircraft climbed above the clouds,but that the second A-10 ``continued in a descent.''
Witnesses on the ground, however, have said they saw one of thejet's two engines on fire before it crashed.

He instructed his charges to draw up plans for "immediate action" that would enable poor families to achieve "real and lasting emancipation" from welfare dependency. "
The success of welfare," he said, "should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare. "
The president correctly sensed that the public wants reform.
If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.
To build on the momentum he created a year ago, the president must make plain his commitment in the State of the Union message next Tuesday.
His Domestic Policy Council has drafted a blueprint.
Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform.
There is a reason for this.
The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy.
This past December, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in Washington, issued a "statement of principles" calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs.
It also insisted that the federal government has "primary responsibility" for operating welfare.
Congressional Democrats seem to be in agreement with the welfare lobby.
It will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $100 billion a year on these programs.
With the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo.

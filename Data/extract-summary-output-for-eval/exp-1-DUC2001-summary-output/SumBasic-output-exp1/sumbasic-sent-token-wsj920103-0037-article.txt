Introduction: As an economist, Robert Barro ("A Free Marketeer's CaseAgainst Term Limits" editorial page, Dec. 24) sees nodifference between minimum-wage legislation, rent control andother government interventions in the free market, and theintervention of congressional term limitation.
Had the Framers envisioned the kind of Imperial Congresswe have today, they without question would have included termlimits in the Constitution.
As it was, tradition dictated"rotation in office," and the need to spell out such arestriction was deemed unnecessary.
With 95% re-electionrates, times have changed.
There are two solid reasons for congressional termlimitation that economists, at least those of thepublic-choice persuasion, should fully appreciate.
First, theless time that a politician spends inside the Beltway theless his or her common sense will be corrupted by the"culture of ruling" that exists there.
Soon youstart thinking your opinion is more important than it reallyis and, worse, that perhaps you should codify your opinion oneverything under the sun.
Such individuals arethe last ones we should want passing laws governing the restof us.
They opt not to run.
Indeed, a true citizen Congress would consist of legislatorswho view their time there as essentially a leave of absencefrom their real jobs.

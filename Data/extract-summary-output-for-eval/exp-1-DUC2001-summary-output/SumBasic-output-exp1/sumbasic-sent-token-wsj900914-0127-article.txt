Introduction:Hurricane activity off the U.S. East Coast will intensify,warned a weather researcher who reported a new method forpredicting Atlantic tropical storms.
William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science atColorado State University and a hurricane forecastingspecialist, said he uncovered a strong association betweenseasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intensehurricanes.
In July he saidthere would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of whichsix would be hurricanes.
Weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricanepatterns more accurately as an early warning for coastalresidents of the U.S. and the Caribbean.
Wind moving acrosswarm ocean air causes powerful updrafts of air bearing seawater that eventually turn into rainclouds.
"Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel withthe number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr. Grayfound a striking correlation.
Mr. Gray searched back in recent history and found thatthe Sahel, which includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Maliand Gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry andwet weather.
He found that the Sahel was especially wet from1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935.
Hurricane activity wasmuch higher during this time than during intervals when theSahel was dry.
Mr. Gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, theSahel is entering a wet period.
He said the droughtconditions ended in 1988 and 1989.
Mr. Gray said his research suggests that climatechanges in the Sahel don't result from global warmingproblems associated with environmental pollution but fromnatural weather cycles.

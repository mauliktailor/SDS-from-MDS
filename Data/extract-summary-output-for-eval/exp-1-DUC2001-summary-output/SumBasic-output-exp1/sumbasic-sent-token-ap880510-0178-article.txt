Introduction:   Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused the UnitedStates of threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinianguerrillas attack American targets.
The United States denied the accusation.
The State Department said in Washington that it had receivedreports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S.involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's secondin command.
Wazir was slain April 16 during a raid on his house near Tunis,Tunisia.
Israeli officials who spoke on condition they not beidentified said an Israeli squad carried out the assassination.
He refused toidentify the government.
Arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villain Baghdad, where extra security guards have been deployed.
He produced a photocopy of the alleged document.
It appeared tobe part of a longer document with the word ``CONFIDENTIAL'' stampedat the bottom.
It read:   ``You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern andparticulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approvedAbu Jihad's assassination.
``Any possible targeting of American personnel and facilities inretaliation for Abu Jihad's assassination would be totallyreprehensible and unjustified.
``These attacks will then be used to justify the assassinationof PLO leaders.''

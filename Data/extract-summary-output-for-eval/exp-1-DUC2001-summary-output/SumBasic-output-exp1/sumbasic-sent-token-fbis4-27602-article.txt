The Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office is looking into a criminal suit filed by the victims of the Dec. 12 "coup d'etat-like incident of the Army" against the perpetrators, including former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.
Chong Sung-hwa is one of the victims.
Paek dismissed as "not true" then Defense Minister No Chae-hyon's statement on Dec. 13, 1979, that martial Law Commander Chong was arrested for interrogation because new evidence was discovered in the course of investigating the assassination.
The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because when Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong Kyong-sik, a member of the joint team, called on the martial law commander at his office three times to question him about his actions on the assassination day, Paek was quoted as saying.
Paek said that without evidence supporting his involvement in the assassination and without then President Choe Kyu- ha's permission, the joint military-prosecution investigation headquarters, led by then Defense Security Commander Maj. Gen. Chon Tu-hwan forcibly arrested Chong, seemingly because of the headquarters' "political motive," suggesting that the Dec. 12 incident was a mutiny by the "new military elite" to topple the government.
The prosecution is considering summoning lawyer Won Kang-hui, who as military prosecutor indicted Chong Sung-hwa on charges of abetting high treason, for questioning.
The prosecution is expected to shortly conclude its probe into whether Chong was an accomplice in the slaying of Pak Chong-hui in October 1979.

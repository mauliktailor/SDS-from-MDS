The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seatlegislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration ofSovereignty of the State of Slovenia.
Slovenia contains 2 million of Yugoslavia's total population of23 million.
Theythreaten that Slovenia will declare full independence fromYugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposalsfor a confederation.
Yugoslavia, including Slovenia, was created in 1918.
Premier Lojze Peterle and other Slovenian leaders also saySlovenia should take urgent steps to join the European Community,no matter what Yugoslavia's Communist-ruled southern states say.
A center-right party came to power there lastmonth in free elections.
It said the state would establish its own intelligence andcounter-intelligence services, that would be independent of theirCommunist-controlled federal counterparts.
The adoption of a declaration of sovereignty has been underdiscussion in the new Parliament since the new government wasinstalled in May.
The timing of Monday's proclamation by Slovenia may have beenaffected by Serbia's sudden decision last week to hold a specialreferendum Sunday and Monday on adopting consitutional reforms thatwould virtually destroy any remaining autonomy for its troubledprovince of Kosovo.
Slovenia and Croatia increasingly have sided with Kosovo'sethnic Albanian majority in its drive for autonomy from Serbia.
In Kosovo's capital of Pristina, after Serbian police on Mondaybarred about 100 ethnic Albanian deputies from entering theprovince's Parliament, about 40 deputies proclaimed Kosovo equal tothe six Yugoslav republics.
The deputies want to revoke a constitutional amendment that gaveSerbia almost total control over Kosovo.

Introduction:The names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of Hugo and Gilbert may be prowling the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the future.
A second rainy summer this year indicates an end to the drought.
The most intense hurricanes, Gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from Africa.
The well-watered conditions in the '50s and '60s produced 31 of the most severe kind (categories 4 and 5) in the 17-year period 1950 to 1967.
Hurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No.
5, or catastrophic storm.
In the '88 and '89 seasons -- June through November -- there have been five.
Last year's Gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across Jamaica and the Mexican Yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere.
Its atmospheric pressure dropped to 885 millibars and its wind speed reached 200 m.p.h.
This September's Hugo, which ripped through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before clobbering South Carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h.
In this century, only two No.
The threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Hurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea.
They get their power from the water's warmth.
The biggest uncertainty, he says, is whether global warming will affect tropical ocean temperatures.

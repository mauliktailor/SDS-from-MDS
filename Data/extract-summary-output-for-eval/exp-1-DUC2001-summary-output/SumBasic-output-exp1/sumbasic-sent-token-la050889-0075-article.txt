Among the women, the race played itself out in a calm, if not orderly, fashion.
Wen Yanmin, a 23-year-old student from Bejing, China, picked her way through a strung-out pack and out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto to win in 2:43:33, also a course record.
Yanmin broke the old record of 2:44:51 set last year by Dianne Rodgers.
Robert Molinatti of Huntington Beach won the wheelchair division in 1:47:59.
Run as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon, which consists of teams from invited countries.
Conditions were excellent at the start of the race, which had its largest-ever field of 4,021 entrants.
The weather for the first 1 1/2 hours was cloudy and cool.
The refrain from the runners was, "It's not the heat, it's the humidity."
The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners.
One by one they fell victim to the weather or other equally debilitating elements.
Gural emphatically said it was too hot, "The sun went to work," was how he put it, and he said he experienced tenderness in his liver during the race.
Samson Obwocha, a Kenyan who lives in Gardena, waited for Gural to fade and then made his move.
"I saw him struggling and I knew I could outkick him," Obwocha said.
He did, and finished fourth in 2:28.08.
"But I wanted to run at 5-minute pace, so I had to lead."
My legs were getting tired, my quads were getting tight.
Still, Wilson built a healthy lead on those "mountains" in Belmont Shores.
Two Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded.
Neither placed in the top 50.
Even as the Chinese runner was bearing down on her as the finish line came into sight.
Konatz was happy with her second place time of 2:43:50.
The marathon is an unpredictable event," she said.
"I knew at 25 miles if someone had a good kick.
So did Ngaire Drake of New Zealand, who was third in 2:44:09.

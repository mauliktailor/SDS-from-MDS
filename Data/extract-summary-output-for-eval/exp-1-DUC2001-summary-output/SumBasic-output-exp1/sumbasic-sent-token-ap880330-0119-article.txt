Introduction:   If the two sides trying to force changes inthe 1990 census both get their way , the results would nearlybalance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.
The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliensfrom its national head count.
Traditionally, it counts everyoneliving in the country.
Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to beincreased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributedamong the states on the basis of population.
The only change, he said, would be that California would gainfive new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two ratherthan just one.
``That's easy to understand, since there are so manyundocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.
O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to bethe big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with again of four and Texas adding three.
Expected to lose one house seat are Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa,Kansas, West Virginia and Montana.

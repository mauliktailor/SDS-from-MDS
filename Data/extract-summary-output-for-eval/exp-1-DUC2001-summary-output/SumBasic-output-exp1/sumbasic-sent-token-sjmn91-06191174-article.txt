Introduction: It's a coincidence of cosmic proportions.
The sun is 400 times wider than themoon.
But the sun also happens to be about 400 times as far away from Earth asthe moon.
"It's maybe the greatest natural occurrence one can witness," said LarryToy, a Chabot College astronomy professor. "
The phenomenon is justawe-inspiring.
"Solar eclipses occur twice a year, when the sun, moon andearth line up.
In these cases the moon's shadow, up to 200 mileswide on the earth's surface, races west to east along the ground at 1,000 to5,000 miles per hour for a few thousand miles.
Most total eclipses getlittle public attention.
They occur over water, over the poles or indifficult-to-reach terrain.
On average, any point on Earth is eclipsed justonce every 360 years.
It's unusual for several reasons.
At its peak, observers will see one of the longest-lasting eclipses thiscentury -- six minutes, 53 seconds.
That was the first confirmation ofAlbert Einstein's prediction that a star's gravity will bend the path oflight.
But in recent years solar eclipses have declined in significancefor researchers.
At 13,800 feet, MaunaKea is the world's tallest island mountain.
It's so high that oxygen deprivation is a serious concern.
Solar wind studiesAt some observatories, astronomers will take repeatedphotographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watchfor material accelerating outward to become solar wind.
They'll be fighting thetemptation to abandon their instruments and go outside to watch.
"Thebiggest problem," Zirin said, "is whether we're going to see the eclipse."

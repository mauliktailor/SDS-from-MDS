'One cause of concern is that the number of cases is continuing to rise, inspite of forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture that the incidence ofcases would peak last year and then decline rapidly.
Another fear is that BSE could cause illness in humans.
It was revealed thisweek that Mr Peter Warhurst, a dairy farmer whose herd had a BSE case in1989, died last year of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.
Both BSE and CJD arecaused by mysterious particles of infectious protein called prions.
His study has shown no change in the pattern of CJDsince BSE started and no other cases among people working with cattle, suchas abattoir staff or vets.

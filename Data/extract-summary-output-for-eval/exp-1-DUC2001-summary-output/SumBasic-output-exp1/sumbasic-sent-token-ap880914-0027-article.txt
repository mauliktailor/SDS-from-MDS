Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center,reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometricpressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT onTuesday.
Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the WesternHemisphere,'' Zimmer said.
Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold tohurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probablyabout half that size, Moore said.
Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemispheresince weather officials began keeping detailed records.
The otherswere the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, whichbulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-footwave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8and killed more than 6,000 people.
Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane centerwas forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs andwindows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.
``Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,'' Zimmersaid.
If the atmospheric conditions in general allow thiswarm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, thenyou can have a severe hurricane.''

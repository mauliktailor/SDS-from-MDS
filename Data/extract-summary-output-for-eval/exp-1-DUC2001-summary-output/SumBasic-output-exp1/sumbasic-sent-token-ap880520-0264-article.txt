Introduction: An official statement issued Fridayconfirmed that federal military commanders met in March andconsidered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia.
The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followedreports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina thatthere had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
Slovenia is considered the most liberal of Yugoslavia's sixrepublics and two autonomous provinces.
But it said there was no discussion at the meeting ``about aplan for action against special warfare in Slovenia.''
The termspecial warfare refers to subversive actions.
The police said ``they had no available data which would justifysuch evaluations,'' according to the ministry statement.
Slovenia's Communist Party presidium also ``expresseddisagreement with part of the military council's opinions,'' saidthe statement.
And Slovenian Communists have frequentlycriticized the way the federal government is dealing with thecountry's economic and social problems.
The letter said military units would be used to crushdemonstrations that were expected to be called to protest thearrests.
It also said the army did not notify Slovenia's civilianleadership of the planned intervention.

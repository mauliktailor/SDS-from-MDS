Introduction: On May 6 the Queen and President Mitterrand will declare the Channel Tunnelopen.
That should be the starting signal for a recovery in the propertymarket in Kent and north eastern France.
That is anexcellent long-term reason to buy.
Le Shuttle's high starting prices for a vehicle and its passengers willeventually come down creating price competition between rail, ferry,catamaran and Hovercraft.
Far-sighted prospective buyers looking near Calais include hauliers wantingto set up a base on the Continent, and Asian entrepreneurs who see anadvantage in being close to Belgium.
The tunnel does not mean much to the continentals.
Inquiries about northernFrench property picked up just before Christmas, says Maggie Kelly, ofFrench agents L'Abri-tanique in Hesdin.
UK buyers can now sell their UK home to put money into a mainresidence or second home in France.
Prices have stopped falling in northernFrance and hopes are high that the tunnel, motorways and new railways willresuscitate the region.
But some paid far too much.
Spectacular price cuts can be found.
Four or five years ago it cost FFr2.5m (afterbeing put on the market at FFr4m).
A mill near Montreuil, which cost FFr2min 1989, sold last year for FFr500,000.French banks and mortgage providers have taken it 'on the chin', said Kelly,and some smaller banks in Calais are none too happy when Britons seek loans.
A small house in Montreuil, a walled town with cobbled streets, costsFFr280,000 from La Residence.
Thirtyminutes' drive from Boulogne, a long, low, Norman-style, half-timbered,farmhouse is for sale at FFr515,250, and 50 minutes away another costsFFr436,800 (reduced from FFr650,000).Near St Omer agent Cote d'Opale is selling an 18th century chateau withwings added in 1908 for FFr4.46m.
La Residence offers another with 28watercress beds and 12 hectares (30 acres) in good condition for FFr2.6m anda flat in town for FFr380,000.In Hesdin, the Wine Society, an English-based group of wine enthusiasts, hasan outlet for members where they can pick up society-recommended wines freeof UK taxes.
When Kelly sees Range Rover and Jaguar drivers collecting their cases ofwine in Hesdin, she would like them to drop into her office 100 metres awayand choose a house as well.
Latitudes has on its books an 18th century town house with internalcourtyard for FFr1.3m, a snip when you think what you would pay in Paris.
It has good shops - including the Philippe Olivier cheese shop  - andrestaurants.
The French favourite is Le Touquet, still an elegant place forParisians to spend le weekend.
Nearby, at Hardelot, there are plenty of building plots for sale beside thetwo golf courses (consult Latitudes).
At the other end of the tunnel Cluttons reports Belgians and Dutchregistering at the Canterbury office for period cottages for around Pounds200,000, and French and Belgians at the Folkestone office - where DavidParry reports that Arabs are interested in blocks of flats on the sea front.
'The tunnel has more psychological impact than anything.
Vendors see it as abonus.
'Once the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the areaand people will move in.
Along the M2, Strutt &amp; Parker offers 52 StMargaret's Street, Rochester, a Grade II * late 17th century house, forPounds 190,000, and a Tudor (1508) and Georgian Kentish hall, CobrahamsoleHall at Sheldwich near Faversham for Pounds 275,000.
The value inFrance is formidable.

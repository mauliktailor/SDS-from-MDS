The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries ofagriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits toallowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn.
Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance togrow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients.
The panel suggested a temporary halt to the ``let it burn''policy, saying the Forest Service and the National Park Serviceneeded more time to refine their fire management plans.
The panel was assembled last September after the worst fireseason ever in drought-primed Yellowstone National Park.
The review team was asked to look at policies throughout thenational parks and wilderness areas, not just Yellowstone.
The panel's report will remain open for public comment for 60days before any recommendations are adopted.
The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areasshould be allowed to burn until government fire management plans areimproved and strengthened.
It said actual fire management plans often have not spelled outwhen natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would beput out.
``No ... natural fires are to be allowed until fire managementplans meet these standards,'' the report said.

There was no immediate reaction to the Slovenian declarationfrom federal authorities or from rival Serbia.
The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seatlegislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration ofSovereignty of the State of Slovenia.
The Ljubljana nightly television news said the declaration askedSlovenian authorities to ``assume control over units of the(Yugoslav) armed forces stationed on Slovenian territory,'' andsaid a 30 percent cut in defense spending would be implemented.
The republic's new authorities demand that Yugoslavia transformitself into a loose confederation of sovereign states.
The demands have been echoed in Croatia, the country'ssecond-largest state.
A center-right party came to power there lastmonth in free elections.
The hard-line Communist government in the largest state ofSerbia vehemently opposes turning Yugoslavia into a confederation.
It said the state would establish its own intelligence andcounter-intelligence services, that would be independent of theirCommunist-controlled federal counterparts.
The adoption of a declaration of sovereignty has been underdiscussion in the new Parliament since the new government wasinstalled in May.
In Kosovo's capital of Pristina, after Serbian police on Mondaybarred about 100 ethnic Albanian deputies from entering theprovince's Parliament, about 40 deputies proclaimed Kosovo equal tothe six Yugoslav republics.
The deputies want to revoke a constitutional amendment that gaveSerbia almost total control over Kosovo.

Few would disagree.
Evenactivities protected by the First Amendment may be regulatedwhen they threaten the rights of others.
This would condition the "right" to keepand bear arms on joining the National Guard.
The Second Amendment,in its language and its history, makes plain that the needfor a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition forthe right to keep and bear arms.
What right must not beinfringed?
The right of the people to serve in the militia.
"Plainly, any conscientious-objector provision would arisenot from a right but from a duty to serve in the militia.
YetMr.
Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says,"that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in themilitia."

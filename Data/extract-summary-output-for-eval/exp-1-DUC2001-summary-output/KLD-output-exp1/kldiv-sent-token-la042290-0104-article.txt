The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
"I think everyone agrees that the risks are low," says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London.
"But they certainly are not zero.
I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder."
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.
The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.
The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed.
The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is budgeting $16 million for 1990.
The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies.
The Southwood report said it is "most unlikely" that the disease poses a threat to humans.
About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last year.
Another form, known as kuru, had been found in cannibals in New Guinea.
The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.

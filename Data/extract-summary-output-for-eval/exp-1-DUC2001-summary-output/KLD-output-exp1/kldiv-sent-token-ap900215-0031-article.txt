The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionallybeen blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty.
While social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the studysuggests that innate susceptibility also contributes.
``We found that there is a systemic difference between whitesand blacks,'' said Dr. William W. Stead.
Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department ofHealth, discovered the racial difference while analyzing healthstatistics from nursing homes and prisons.
``It's a very intriguing finding,'' commented Dr. GeorgeComstock of Johns Hopkins University.
``I never quite believeanything until somebody replicates it.
At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,Dr.
George Curlin called the findings ``plausible and provocative.''
I would say that biology isrelatively minor.''
When they were retested at least two months later, 14percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of newinfections.
The disease, which attacks thelungs, has long been associated with poor, crowded livingconditions.
Stead's study found that blacks got infected more readily thanwhites, regardless of the race of the person who initially broughtthe infection into the nursing home.
In homes where the initialsource of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12percent of whites caught the infection.
When the primary source wasblack, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted thebacteria.
This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infectedwhites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.
``This helps explain why black people are more susceptible totuberculosis than are white people,'' said Crowle.
At the turn of the century, TB was the nation's leading cause ofdeath.
Others possible factors include homelessness andimmigration of people from areas where the disease is still common.

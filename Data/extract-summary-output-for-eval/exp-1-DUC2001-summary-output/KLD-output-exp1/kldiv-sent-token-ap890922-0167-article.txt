But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting toolswere reports from aircraft or ships.
Information from the satellite isused to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models thattelevision viewers see every night.
To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyzesupercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similarstorms and the current path of the hurricane.
Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the MassachussettsInstitute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enoughinformation about the wind and temperatures that affect ahurricane's path.
``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanescomes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a verygood job,'' Emmanuel said.
Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improvingevery year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
``We have to remember that those models used are only guidanceproducts,'' Pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of theforecaster to predict the storm's path.

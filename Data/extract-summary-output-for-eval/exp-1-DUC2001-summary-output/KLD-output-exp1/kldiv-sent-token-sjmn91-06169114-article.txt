Newspaper headlines have documented Miami's subsequent hurricanes.

About 60 of these waves of air, not water, form everyyear.

Fourteen becametropical storms, seven of which became hurricanes, fewer than usual.
People who venture into such dubious endeavors as long-term hurricaneforecasting said this could be another light year.
But, they said, arelatively quiet year does not guarantee a thing.
They are a conservative bunch, not given to Sunday-supplement scarestories.
"Historically, south Florida has had more hurricanesthan any other site," said Jerry Jarrell, a hurricane specialist eyeingMiami's 27-year hiatus nervously.
"We would expect a major hurricane to hitwithin 75 miles of Miami every eight years.
"How many high-rises did they have on those barrierislands up in South Carolina?
None.
I think all these folks in their MiamiBeach condos are going to be in for a rude awakening.
"A worst-case storm,with winds topping 150 mph, would put 5 feet of water in Joe's Stone Crabsrestaurant, a Miami Beach landmark, and 9 feet of water on Biscayne Boulevardin downtown Miami.
Surging water could reach levels of 13 1/2 feet inlow-lying areas south of Miami.
Hurricanes changedirection and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialistssaid, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles.
Mayfield went toMiami Beach recently to discuss his model with officials there, and what heheard worried him.
"That makes my hair stand straight up."

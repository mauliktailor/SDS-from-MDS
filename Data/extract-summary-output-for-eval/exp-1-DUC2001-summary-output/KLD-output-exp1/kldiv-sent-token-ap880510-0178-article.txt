The United States denied the accusation.
The State Department said in Washington that it had receivedreports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S.involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's secondin command.
Wazir was slain April 16 during a raid on his house near Tunis,Tunisia.
Israeli officials who spoke on condition they not beidentified said an Israeli squad carried out the assassination.
He refused toidentify the government.
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphydenied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLOofficials.
He produced a photocopy of the alleged document.
It appeared tobe part of a longer document with the word ``CONFIDENTIAL'' stampedat the bottom.
The document, which was typewritten in English, referred toWazir by his code name, Abu Jihad.
It read:   ``You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern andparticulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approvedAbu Jihad's assassination.
``On April 18th (a) State Department spokesman said that theUnited States `condemns this act of political assassination,' `hadno knowledge of' and `was not involved in any way in thisassassination.
``Any possible targeting of American personnel and facilities inretaliation for Abu Jihad's assassination would be totallyreprehensible and unjustified.

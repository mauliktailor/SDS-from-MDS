William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at ColoradoState University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantichurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but aboveaverage for the decade.
The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of thelast six hurricane seasons.
Those years brought just two to fivehurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.
He issued an early ``outlook''Friday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference.
``It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which doesform in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the averagehurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season,''Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.
In 1984, when therewere five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven.
He said the droughthas robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start theirescalation into hurricanes.
That pattern eventually will change, he said, ``but it isimpossible to say when this shift will occur.''
Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conferencestressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during thelull in hurricanes; a surge in storms, up to the levels of the1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.

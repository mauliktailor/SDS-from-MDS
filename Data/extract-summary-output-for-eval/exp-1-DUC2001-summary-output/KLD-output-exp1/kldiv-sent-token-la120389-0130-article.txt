A second rainy summer this year indicates an end to the drought.
The well-watered conditions in the '50s and '60s produced 31 of the most severe kind (categories 4 and 5) in the 17-year period 1950 to 1967.
The atmospheric pressure at its center drops drastically and its wind speed exceeds 155 m.p.h.
In the drier 17-year period of 1970 to 1987, there were only 13 severe storms.
In the '88 and '89 seasons -- June through November -- there have been five.
Last year's Gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across Jamaica and the Mexican Yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere.
Its atmospheric pressure dropped to 885 millibars and its wind speed reached 200 m.p.h.
and an atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches).
Officially a 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it "may be a borderline 5," says meteorologist Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
In this century, only two No.
They get their power from the water's warmth.
To develop, they need tropical ocean-surface temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. "
"Sea-surface temperatures set the upper limits."
The gradual warming of the Earth results from the greenhouse effect, caused primarily by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, which, like the glass of a greenhouse, trap heat.

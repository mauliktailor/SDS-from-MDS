Both areas are situated along the Pacific "ring of fire," the huge faults created by the collision of massive plates of the earth's surface. "
Chile, along with Alaska, are the sites that have had the biggest seismic occurrences," said Prof. Edgar Kausel, chairman of the Geophysics Department at the University of Chile.
"Our buildings performed very well," he said.
Older buildings have been replaced over the years.
Chilean earthquakes tend to be sharper and last longer than those of California, leading to differences in building design.
While California engineers have promoted a flexible design of steel framed buildings that allows them to swing in a quake, Chileans opt for stiffer construction.
Chilean buildings are of reinforced concrete with more inside walls.
"Our buildings move little compared to (those of) the Americans," said Arze.
Descriptions of earthquakes in Chile date back to Spanish settlers in 1575.
Parts of the coast stretching south from the city of Concepcion, 325 miles south of Santiago, dropped nine feet.
"It was the biggest registered in the history of seismic instrumention," said Kausel.
About 5,000 people were killed in the sparsely populated area, most of them when the coastline dropped.

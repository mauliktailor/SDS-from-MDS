Introduction: The 1990 Atlantic hurricane seasonbegins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East andGulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a newera of destructive storms.
The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by atropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavyrain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into ahurricane.
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportpredicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine toTexas will grow 60 percent, counting from 1960 until 2010.
``We can't stopthe hurricanes.
The only thing we can do is work on betterpreparedness and emergency planning.''
Gilbert killed more than 300 people and caused heavy damage fromthe Lesser Antilles to Mexico.
Hugo killed 28 people in the easternCaribbean and 29 more in South Carolina and caused a record $10billion in damage.
Between 1940 and 1969, the United States was hit by 22 hurricaneswith minimum winds of 110 mph.
There are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from Category 1,which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to Category 5,with top winds greater then 155 mph.

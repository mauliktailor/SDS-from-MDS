The Census Bureau, as it has in the past, is planning to count all residents of the nation regardless of legal status.
Replied Rep. Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.): " A very clear reading of the Constitution says that we shall count all those who are present."
Although the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments, it's largely driven by geography.
"You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals," says Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.), who leads the charge against the practice in the House.
Organizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign.
As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential," Mr. Vargas says.
"If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder."
The Census Bureau agrees.
"We tell people: Put your name down on the census form.
We won't report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants}," says Peter Bonpanne, an assistant director.
"If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody's legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people's participation."
The bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens.
Rep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems.
"The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power .
.
.
not to gather demographic information."
All sides in the debate predict a lawsuit no matter what Congress does.
That was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868.
Only "Indians not taxed" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940.
Much of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word "person" in references to the census.
Elsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word "citizen."
The word "person" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War.

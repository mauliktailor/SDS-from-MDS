So the increase could be as much as 20% on top-grade diamonds.
The rise follows an average price increase of 14.5% last year.
By changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said.
"Few listened to us two years ago when we advised clients to buy diamonds at depressed values," Mr. Zucker said.
"Now they must accept higher prices."
"The price rise provides the necessary psychological lift to the market," said Peter Miller, a mining analyst at Shearson Lehman Securities in London.
Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of the year, dealers said.
In 1985, at the low point of a deep slump, a top quality stone was $8,500 a carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980.
A carat equals 200 milligrams.
Demand is especially buoyant in the Far East.
In the first seven months of 1987, Japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added.
Only one out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings less than two decades ago; now more than two-thirds buy. "
The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of diamonds for Japanese buyers," Mr. Lamont says.
Diamonds are priced in U.S. dollars.
Analysts are predicting sales of $3 billion in 1987.
In 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says.

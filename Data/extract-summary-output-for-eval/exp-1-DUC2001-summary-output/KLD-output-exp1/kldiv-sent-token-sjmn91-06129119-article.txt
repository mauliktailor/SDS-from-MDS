Introduction:CONSIDER THE following case: A suspect involved in a high-speed chase refusesto stop.
This was a real case involving a Santa Clara County police agency.
Irepresented the suspect.
There is no mention of police brutality.
None of the back-upofficers reported any brutality.
Another officerreported that the only verbal abuse was by the suspect toward officers.
The suspect subsequently complained of brutality.
The witnesses also said:The suspect at notime resisted.
The only words from the suspect were pleas for help.
What if there had notbeen four citizens who observed the brutal beating of my client?One ofthe problems in monitoring police brutality is that almost all victims ofpolice abuse have themselves committed some kind of law violation.
But there is another problem: apolice discipline system that is cloaked in secrecy.
MacNamara diagnosed the problem as anorganizational attitude for which the leadership must take responsibility.
Unfortunately, MacNamara also believes that San Jose does not need a citizens'review board.
I respectfully disagree.
That is precisely what we need.
This is bad public policy.
As MacNamara points out, police are public servants.
A minimalinvasion of their privacy is a small price to pay for the power to maim andkill.
Monitoring police brutality is further complicated by the fact thatlocal communities leave it to the police departments to investigate citizencomplaints.
The attitude of the public willdetermine the effectiveness of the police discipline system.
A system can betheoretically sound, but it must be respected by the public.
I would further recommend that localcommunities establish citizen review boards.
Or a .45.

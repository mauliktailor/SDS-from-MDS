Three of the crewmen were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel and a fourth was plucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter.
The Coast Guard also said there were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another boat.
But Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead said the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in excess of 60 m.p.h.
and waves were at 12 feet and building.
The boat was ordered into port because of the impending storm.
Late Monday afternoon, Chantal was about 200 miles south-southeast of Galveston, Tex., traveling northwest at about 10 m.p.h.
The best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the western Louisiana or upper Texas coast.
Grocery stores began reporting a steady demand for hurricane staples -- bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows.
One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane.
In that event, the Houston area would have "extensive flooding," said Bill Evans, flood watch director for the Harris County Flood Control District.
Chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the hurricane season June 1.
Tropical Storm Allison dumped huge amounts of rain on Texas and Louisiana in June, and Tropical Storm Barry dissipated in the Atlantic without reaching land.

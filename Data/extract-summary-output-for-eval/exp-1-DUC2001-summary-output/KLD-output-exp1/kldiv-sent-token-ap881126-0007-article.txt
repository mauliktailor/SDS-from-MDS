Introduction:   Further study of a newly isolated hormone foundin the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for themost common form of the disease, a scientist says.
Cooper, who has been working with scientists at OxfordUniversity, described the hormone research this week at the 13thInternational Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney, Australia.
In his presentation, Cooper said the hormone, dubbed ``amylin,''was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreasesof diabetics.
In Type IIdiabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body'sinsulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high.
Complications can include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrenethat requires amputations.
It often can be controlled through diet and exercise.
He also said reseachers hope to develop a test to detect diabetesvery early in its development.
The new work is ``a very important finding'' if amylin trulyblocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, F.Xavier Pi-Sunyer, an authority on Type II diabetes, said Friday.

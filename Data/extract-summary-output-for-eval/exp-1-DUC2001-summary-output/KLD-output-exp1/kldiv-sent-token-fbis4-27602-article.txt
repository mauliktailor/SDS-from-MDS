The Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office is looking into a criminal suit filed by the victims of the Dec. 12 "coup d'etat-like incident of the Army" against the perpetrators, including former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.
Chong Sung-hwa is one of the victims.
The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because when Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong Kyong-sik, a member of the joint team, called on the martial law commander at his office three times to question him about his actions on the assassination day, Paek was quoted as saying.
The prosecution is considering summoning lawyer Won Kang-hui, who as military prosecutor indicted Chong Sung-hwa on charges of abetting high treason, for questioning.
Won recently said there was no criminal evidence against Chong when he indicted him, adding the military prosecution then made "a different evaluation" of his actions on the assassination day.
The prosecution is expected to shortly conclude its probe into whether Chong was an accomplice in the slaying of Pak Chong-hui in October 1979.

Introduction:KEY Hispanic groups in the US are making stringent side agreements, aimed atprotecting worker rights and the environment, a condition of their supportfor the North American Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.
'The most competitive sectors on both sides of the border would win,' saidProf Raul Hinojosa, of the University of California in Los Angeles and aleader of the Southwest Voter Registration Project. '
Trade would produce jobgrowth on both sides of the border, but the question is how those jobs aredistributed.
However, business organisations like the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce andthe Hispanic Trade Council are enthusiastic backers of the deal.
Mr Abel Guerra of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said he feared sideagreements dealing with issues on the environment and labour rights couldjeopardise Nafta. '
A vast majority of us(Hispanics) will be losers unless there are fundamental changes in thecurrent Nafta,' he said.

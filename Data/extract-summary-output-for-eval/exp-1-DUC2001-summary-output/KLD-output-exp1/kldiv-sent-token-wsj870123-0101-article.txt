Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty.
The president correctly sensed that the public wants reform.
To pull away now would be to undercut the welfare-reform movement just as it has hit its stride.
It would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs.
Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform.
This suggests that the Democrats aren't as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are.
The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy.
It also insisted that the federal government has "primary responsibility" for operating welfare.
Congressional Democrats seem to be in agreement with the welfare lobby.
However, the public wants the system changed.
With the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo.
With the ball in its court, Congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor.

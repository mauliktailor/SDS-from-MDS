Proposition 131 would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms, state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office; Proposition 140 would hold Assembly members to six years in office, state senators and statewide elected officials to eight.
The Times asked six legislators and legislative specialists.
The argument that the lobbyists would take advantage of them, I believe, is not valid.
(Term limits) would stop (politics) from being a professional occupation.
I think it will return the Legislature to more of a citizen-type legislator.
I knew the system there pretty well.
I think the age bracket would creep up a little more.
Folks who want to do it as a public service.

It is not just the numbers.
So, governing the state of California .
.
.
is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think.
And the other thing a lot of people seem to think is that you the governor -- or you the legislator -- can get up there and solve these problems tomorrow.
Well, there are some of them that are almost not solvable.
.
.
That is probably the most negative impact.
There has been a national movement that started in California, 25 years ago, to really strengthen the role of legislatures and to make them co-equal branches of government; things like term limitations, which would restrict the power and authority of legislatures, are a step backward in that movement.
It would mean that, in relative terms, the legislatures would cede more power and authority to the executive branch, to lobbyists and to legislative staff.

As to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of California, a lot of people think that this is a partisan issue.
.
.
Representation does not occur well then.
.
.
It seems that as we (Latinos) begin to make entries into the political process, the rules are beginning to change.
Elected officials are supposed to represent the people who elect them.
Being an elected official takes experience.
It just doesn't make sense.
There are a lot of problems with our political process, but this is not the solution.
We should throw the rotten apples out, but not the whole system with it.
So what it will do is reverse the incentive.

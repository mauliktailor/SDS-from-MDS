Introduction: The Jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana, isknown as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is therichest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of thestones it yields.
Meanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of SouthAfrica, another diamond mine, the Finsch, where operations started in 1964,has been given a new lease of life.
Having dug an open pit 423 metres deep, miners have now gone underground.
It alsoremains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its100-year-old mines at Kimberley are now running down.
The value of Jwaneng toBotswana cannot be overstated.
No wonder Jwaneng's company slogan is Rephtas imisa Botswana, which translates as 'We make Botswana sparkle'.Production started at Jwaneng in 1982.
Now a so-called fourth stream isbeing completed which is adding one-third to processing capacity.
In turn,this means a 21 per cent rise in the number of carats produced.
Last yearthe mine treated 5.8m tonnes of ore which yielded 8.546m carats of diamonds,well below the 1992 output when the 5.77m tonnes treated gave up more than9m carats.
Jwaneng's open pit has reached a depth of 190 metres.
Our costs compare with the bestin the group.
When, as occasionallyhappens, rock crashes on to the LHD trucks, it is relatively simply to haulthe vehicles out virtually undamaged.
Mr Webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres, atwhich point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to makerecovery viable.
About 500 of its 1,900 employees were laid off in August 1992.
But when marketconditions improve, production can be brought back up to previous levels inabout six months.

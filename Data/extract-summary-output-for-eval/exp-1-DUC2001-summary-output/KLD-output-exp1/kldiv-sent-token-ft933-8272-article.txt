He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease.
'Our worst predictions are coming true,' he said. '
I find it unbelievablethat the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling thepublic there is no danger.
'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patientoccurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient hadpresumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the healthdepartment said.
'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between thecases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.
'Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical featurestypical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usuallyoccurs in late middle age.

Although sheep-derived feeds werebanned from sale in 1988, farmers apparently continued to use existingstocks for longer than the ministry had expected.
The incubation period isalso longer than originally expected.
According to theirinvestigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf - which would prolongthe epidemic - is very rare or non-existent.
Unlike viruses and bacteria, prions contain no genetic material oftheir own.
Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.
But 'transmission is dose dependent,' Collinge says.

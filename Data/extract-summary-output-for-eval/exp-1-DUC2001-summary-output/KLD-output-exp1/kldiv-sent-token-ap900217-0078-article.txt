Introduction: Drugs are now available that can put AIDSpatients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that avaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel ofAIDS experts said Saturday.
``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducingremission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber CancerInstitute in Boston.
``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of peoplewho would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annualmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDSepidemic may be coming to an end.
A number of treatments for AIDSand AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many ofthem are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
``It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliverand require monitoring,'' Haseltine said.
``Unless we develop a vaccine, the future of this epidemicworldwide will be extremely grim,'' he said.
A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful,said James Mullins of Stanford University.
But that has changed.``There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,''Mullins said.
Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses haveshown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believethat similar vaccines can be found for humans.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
``It's likely to be yet another health problem imposed on theinner cities, where the health problems are already legion,''Vermund said.

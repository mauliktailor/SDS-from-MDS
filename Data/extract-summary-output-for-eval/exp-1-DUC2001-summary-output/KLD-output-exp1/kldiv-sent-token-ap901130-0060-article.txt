The season ends today.
In 1988 and 1989, there was near normal rainfall in the Sahel,the semi-arid land on the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert.
Some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end ofa 20-year drought - and may have spawned Gilbert in 1988 and Hugoin 1989.
He based his forecast on several factors, including ananticipated below-average rainfall in the Sahel.
But Gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlookfor the 1990s and the early years of the next century is for moreintense hurricanes than those of the last two decades.
``Perhaps the Gilberts and the Hugos were signaling that ,'' hesaid, recalling Hurricane Gilbert that wracked the Caribbean andHurricane Hugo that devastated South Carolina - two of the mostdestructive Atlantic hurricanes ever.
In this year's season, there were 14 named storms, eight of themhurricanes.
The average number of storms is nine, with about sixbecoming hurricanes.
While many of the storms spun harmlessly through the Atlantic,several caused their share of destruction.
Storms become hurricanesif winds reach 74 mph.

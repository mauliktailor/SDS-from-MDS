For a timeVenetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission forseven-day working, moved to a five-day week.
Last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output andprocessed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats.
Mr Gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the CSO quota, Venetia'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production'.This year will be a time of consolidation.
Nevertheless,Venetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764.
A mine ofVenetia's size in the past would have employed 2,000.
The total has beenkept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by 'fewerpeople employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs',according to Mr David Gadd-Claxton, ore extraction manager.
Venetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years.
It isalso the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of exportearnings.
Thisprovides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerfulposition from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel.
For example, there are no migrant workers at the mine.
Employees are bussedin from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families.
Here worn out equipment will be stockpiledand sold off when the mine closes.
It could be worth millions of dollars.

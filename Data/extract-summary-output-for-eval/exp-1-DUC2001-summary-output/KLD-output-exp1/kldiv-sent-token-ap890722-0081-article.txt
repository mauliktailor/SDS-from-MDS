Introduction: A 1987 state constitutional amendmentbroadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felonsmay own guns, a judge ruled.
Prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did notintend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing inthe amendment indicated such an intent.
``If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict orqualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted aconstitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions,''Perkins wrote.
``Maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the mostbroad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar stateamendments,'' he wrote.

The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep andbear arms ``for the common defense.''
He previously had beenconvicted under the state's habitual offender law for operating amotor vehicle after his driver's license had been revoked.

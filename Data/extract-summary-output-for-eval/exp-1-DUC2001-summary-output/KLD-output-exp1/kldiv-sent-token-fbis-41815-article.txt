The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable.
The scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows.
The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows.
It has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx.
In the United States, mink have been affected by it.
Infected feed cannot account for four cases.
It is possible but unlikely that the mothers were carriers that passed on the infection without having symptoms themselves.
If this were so, it would have important implications for the disease in cows.
It is more likely, the scientists believe, that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along, as with more mundane infections.
If they proved as vulnerable as the kudu, this could be disastrous.
The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.
If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease.

Introduction: Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday.
Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or sneeze.
About half of these are infectious.
In these individuals, the organism can remain dormant without causing active disease for many years unless the immune system is somehow impaired.
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's immune system.
This is what is happening in developing nations, where the AIDS epidemic is raging. "
In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with tuberculosis," Bloom said.
"Many of these people do, in fact, die of AIDS.
But if they're not treated for tuberculosis, those people will be spreading the disease (tuberculosis) in their communities.
At that time, they noticed a startling and unexpected drop in the rate of decline of tuberculosis cases.
This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases.
The overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per 100,000 population, he said.
In New York City, which has the highest number of AIDS cases in the nation, the incidence is 36 per 100,000, Bloom said.
However, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and compliance is a major problem.

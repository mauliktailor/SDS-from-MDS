Introduction: A major earthquake registering 7.2 on theRichter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today,the U.S. Geological Survey says.
The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05p.m.
Friday, said USGS spokesman Don Finley.
It was the largestearthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5, 1978.
Majorearthquakes in the Solomons usually don't cause much damage or manycasualties because the area is sparsely populated and notextensively developed.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said noPacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ wasgenerated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes insea levels.
Saturday's earthquake was the strongest in the world in fivemonths, Finley said.

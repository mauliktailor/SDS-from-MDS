Hercondition worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St. John'sand moved into intensive care on Friday.
She's not well.
While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator,it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G.Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert whoemphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.
Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restoreoxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathingdifficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said.
``It may be that because she is such a prominent person, theyare taking a conservative course,'' he added.
Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,particularly back troubles from filming of ``National Velvet' in1945, when she fell off a horse.
In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pillsand painkillers.

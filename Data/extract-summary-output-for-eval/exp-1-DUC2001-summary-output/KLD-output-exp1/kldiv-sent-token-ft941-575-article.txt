Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row tomorrow afternoon.
In 1990, certain bovine offals, like brain and spleen, were banned for humanconsumption.
Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of livecattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected cows.
In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as comingfrom herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.
'We feel we have a sound case and other member states and the Commissionagree with us,' a senior British agriculture official said.

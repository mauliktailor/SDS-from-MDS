The breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to maintain two rail tunnels still being bored.
It marked a symbolic milestone in Europe's biggest engineering project.
Workers in overalls looked on and applauded. "
God save the queen!"
Vive la France!"
came the reply from the British side.
The $16.7-billion Channel Tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to London by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in June, 1993.
The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry.
Fares for the undersea crossing have not been set.
The British tunnelers actually linked up with the French on Oct. 29, when workers drilled a 2-inch hole through the chalk in a service tunnel.
Bonjour," boomed Fagg. "
Michel Delebarre and Malcolm Rifkind, the French and British transportation ministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness the handshake.
Fagg and Rifkind rode on to Sangatte, while Cozette and Delebarre headed for Folkestone to join in celebrations that lasted into the night.
Nine workers have been killed during the project.
The tunnel is viewed positively in France, where it is expected to revive economically depressed northern areas.

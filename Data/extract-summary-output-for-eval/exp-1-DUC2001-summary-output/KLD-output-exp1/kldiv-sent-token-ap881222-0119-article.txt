Introduction: Some of this year's drought in the Midwest mayhave been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equatorin the Pacific Ocean, according to a new computer study reportedThursday.
The authors are Kevin E. Trenberth and Grant W. Branstator of theNational Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., andPhillip A. Arkin of the Climate Analysis Center of the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Camp Springs, Md.
``Such an answer is, however, just a brief description of theweather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at thecause.
A more satisfying response would address why the jet streamwas displaced northward,'' the team wrote.
Their proposed answer focuses on the development in April, Mayand June of drought in the Midwest, where several states recordedless rain than at any time since 1895.
But during the April-June period there were alternating high andlow pressure centers across much of the northern half of the WesternHemisphere: A high-pressure center north of Hawaii, a low in theGulf of Alaska, a high in central Canada extending down into thenorthern Great Plains states and a low on the East Coast.
At the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surfacetemperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal.
When this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, thepattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems wasreproduced.
The below-normal equatorial temperature by itself didnot give such a result.
The authors took note of computer models predicting increasedfrequency of drought with the buildup of the ``greenhouse effect''global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxidein the atmosphere.

Thomas, 41, will be a judge on the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appealsin the District of Columbia.
As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission overthe last eight years, he has been one of the most visible blackofficials in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
But liberals have criticized his record.
...
Danforth, Thomas' chief Senate supporter and former employer,said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer.
``I hired him twice,'' Danforth said.
``People say, 'Don't youever make a mistake?'
Well, yeah, but not twice.''
Simpson said the panel's investigation of the employmentcommission was flawed to begin with.
Thomas was born in poverty in rural Georgia, worked his waythrough college and is a graduate of Yale Law School.
Beforebecoming chairman of the commission, he worked under Danforth inthe Missouri attorney general's office and in the Senate as wellfor the Monsanto Corp.   Civil rights forces have been divided over the nomination.
TheAlliance for Justice, a liberal court-watcher group based inWashington, and several senior citizens groups have been critical.
But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peopledid not take a stand on the issue.

Introduction: Forecasters preparing for Thursday'sopening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predictthe arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial toever-growing coastal populations.
And only one satellite is available for trackinghurricanes.
``We've got onesatellite and they're telling us it'll do the job.
If it blinks,how do you track weather?''
Col. Darrell Hayes.
``We're not disputing that the hurricane center and the weatherservice need the data.
Besides the flights, forecasters depend on radar and satellitedata.
There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center.
But they've been due fora long time and aren't expected before late 1990.
``It is a major concern for us,'' Sheets said.
Forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern ofhurricane activity in recent years.
They really have verylittle concept of what a hurricane is.''

The tablet was found in 1948 in the ruins of Ugarit, an ancientcity near Syria's Mediterranean coast.
One side appears to tell of asolar eclipse, and the reverse side reads, ``Two livers wereexamined: danger.''
They concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tabletmisidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred.
Thenew study indicated the eclipse really happened in late February orearly March.
In addition, the text apparently indicates that Mars was visibleat the time of the eclipse, the Dutch researchers said.
Only the event in 1223 B.C.
fills the bill, the researcherssaid.
The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and thestudy assumes that citizens of Ugarit followed an Egyptian-stylecalendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said.

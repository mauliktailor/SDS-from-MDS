The first President to come under the restriction was Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican who might very well have won a third term.
The latest institutional patients to be wheeled into the shock-trauma unit are the state legislatures.
The quack therapy being performed on them is the imposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve.
The first cut took place on Sept. 18, when Oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly a ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years' service.
The Oklahoma referendum is none of these.
What makes term limitation such a singularly inappropriate tool is the almost total lack of connection between the fancied sins of the lawmakers and the discipline proposed.
The very weakness and vulnerability to corruption that have often plagued state legislatures usually result from the amateurism of lawmakers -- the quality that term-limitation backers now assert as a virtue.
Where state legislators are underpaid, have no professional staffs and meet rarely, they usually come under the sway of full-time governors, executive-branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists.
Lobbyists, of course, will rejoice.
Their influence over these legislative birds of passage will grow because they will be guaranteed a perennial crop of callow and ignorant lawmakers.
One thing that legislators now have going for them is that they can become conversant with public issues and so challenge, if they care to, the self-serving propaganda of the special interests.
Celebrating, along with the lobbyists, will be the legislative staffs whose tenure would be unaffected.
Ultimately, what the term limit amounts to is an indictment of citizenship.
It is an admission that the voters are civic imbeciles who cannot discriminate between bad lawmakers and good ones.

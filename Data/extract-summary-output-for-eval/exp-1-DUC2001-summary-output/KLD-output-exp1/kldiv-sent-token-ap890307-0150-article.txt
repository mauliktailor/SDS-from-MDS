``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,'' saidEd Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, where 600children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m. PST.
``It was certainly a lively crowd,'' he said.
``There was afestival atmosphere.''
As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partialeclipse, those watching through Caltech's telescopes could seemountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun.
Alsovisible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group ofsunspots that on Monday produced the most intense solar flare _ aburst of heat and radiation _ since 1984.
``There was a stunning view of that large sunspot group,'' Kruppsaid.
Views were best farther west and north.
But because the eclipsewas partial most people didn't notice the slight dimming of sunlight.
Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets indowntown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent ofthe sun at 9:13 a.m.
In San Francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52a.m., but the event wasn't visible because of clouds that were sothick they delayed arriving flights at the airport.
A slight dimming was noticed in Seattle, where partly cloudyskies allowed a glimpse of the 56 percent eclipse at 10:10 a.m. PST.
The percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipseat other locations included 52 percent at 11:28 a.m. MST inEdmonton, Alberta; 46 percent at 11:09 a.m. MST in Boise, Idaho; 36percent at 11:10 a.m. MST in Salt Lake City; 35 percent at 9:58 a.m. PST in Las Vegas; 25 percent at 11:17 a.m. MST in Denver; 15 percentat 12:42 p.m. CST in Minneapolis, and a measly 3 percent at 12:44p.m.
CST in Milwaukee.
Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughlyonce every four centuries, though they are visible about every twoyears from somewhere on Earth, he said.

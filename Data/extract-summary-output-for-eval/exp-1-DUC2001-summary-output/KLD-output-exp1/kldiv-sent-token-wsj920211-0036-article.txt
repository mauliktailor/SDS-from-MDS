For example, one letter writer, commenting on my Dec. 12Counterpoint, "Gun Control Is Constitutional," felt compelledto instruct me that the word militia means "the wholepeople," a point I quoted three times and also paraphrasedonce in my brief article.
Thesubject is not just the militia but "a well-regulatedmilitia," people trained, disciplined and armed for defenseof the community under commanding officers.
I said nothing like that.
We have many rights not enumerated in the Constitution,such as the right to marry, drive a car or own a dog.
Theserights are not denied just because the Constitution doesn'tmention them; and the rights are not disparaged by the factthat we must obtain a marriage license, driver's license or adog license.
In the same way, the right to own a gun is not disparagedby being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled.
All the letters missed entirely my point about requiringgun owners to "sign up" with (not "join") the National Guard.
I likened it to the current law requiring 18-year-old men toregister with the Selective Service.
Registering is verydifferent from enlisting for active service.
Another letter writer thinks I have confused the issue bycalling the duty to serve in the militia a right to serve,but if he will look at the debates in the First Congress hewill see that there is no confusion at all, that the authorsof the Second Amendment were talking about the right toserve.
Plain and simple, it is no barrier to sensible guncontrol.

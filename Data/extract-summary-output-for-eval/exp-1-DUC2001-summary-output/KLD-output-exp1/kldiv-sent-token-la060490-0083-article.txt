Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales.
The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the "mad cow" scare.
"It's totally unjustified and illegal," said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the Meat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization.
Mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since it was first noticed in the mid-1980s.
The cows become aggressive and then wobbly-legged before dying.
No one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow's brain.
But the prime suspect is tainted cow feed.
On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died from a disease identical to BSE.
The press went wild with the story, suggesting, in boldface, that if cats can get it, people can too.
Panic ensued. "
BSE has been around for six or seven years," said David Lewis of the Meat and Livestock Commission.
"And until the cat, it hadn't been brought into the home."
Two thousand schools dropped beef from their menus.
The government and meat industry fought back.

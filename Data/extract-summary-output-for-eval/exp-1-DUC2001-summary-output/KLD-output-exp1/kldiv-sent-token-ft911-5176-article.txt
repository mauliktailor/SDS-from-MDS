Introduction: Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse ofstatistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries.
The debts represent loans with a substantial grant element.
The limiting case is the international development association loans,50-year loans, unindexed for inflation, at zero interest.
This is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuingsaving certificates are burdened when they pay interest.
If the funds areused productively, debt service is not a burden in the critical sense thatthe debtors would be better off if they had not borrowed.
It is pertinent also that the poorest are low among the priorities of thelocal rulers.
State help for the poorest, especially the rural poor,conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and maynot accord with local mores.
Such considerations are reinforced byubiquitous civil conflict.
An Arab-dominated Sudanese government will nothelp the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armedconflict; the Sinhalese government will not help the Tamil poor, nor willthe government of Ethiopia the poor of Tigre.
As I said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of Third Worldpoverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centredsentiment.

Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by blackactivists that he would bring back the machine politics of his latefather, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 yearsbefore his death in 1976.
But now Daley finds himself on the defensive.
Some blackpoliticians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by notdoing enough to stop it.
``There's been no demonstrable change on the part of whiteleadership in this city to end racism,'' said Bob Starks, associateprofessor of inner city studies at Northeastern IllinoisUniversity.
But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is ``irresponsiblepolitical rhetoric'' from black politicians who are looking aheadto the 1991 mayoral election.
Daley is filling the remaining twoyears of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's firstblack mayor who was just a few months into his second term when hedied in November 1987.
``Everyone should join together... to help alleviate this problem.''
Also last week, a human relations task force made up of businessand civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago wasfueled by ``a shocking lack of contact'' between the city's ethnicgroups.
The poice department's record was defended by PoliceSuperintendent LeRoy Martin, a black appointee of Washington.
When it's wrong, I must correct it.

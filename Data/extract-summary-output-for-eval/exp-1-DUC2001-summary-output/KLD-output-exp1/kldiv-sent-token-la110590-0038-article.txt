Introduction: Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz.
Ikangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by winning in course-record time, and Waitz, who had won the race nine times, each ran fourth in their respective divisions.
Since Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no American has won the women's division.
Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., finished second among the women for the second consecutive year, five seconds behind Panfil to make it the closest finish in the race's 21-year history.
Wakiihuri, who bolted away at 20 miles, clocked 2:12:39, the slowest since Orlando Pizzolato of Italy won in 2:14:53 in 1984, when the temperature reached 79 degrees, the hottest in race history.
Sunday, the temperature got as high as 72 degrees and the humidity peaked at 66 percent.
Ken Martin of Dallas, the runner-up last year, failed to finish this time.
Bothered by a virus for the past two months, he dropped out after 19 miles.
After staying with the lead pack for the first 20 miles, the cool, composed Wakiihuri took control and pulled away to a 40-second victory over Salvador Garcia of Mexico.
In only seven previous marathons, the 27-year-old Wakiihuri has won the '87 world championship, the '89 London Marathon in a personal-best 2:09:03 and the '90 Commonwealth Games marathon.
He also finished second in the 1988 Olympic Games.

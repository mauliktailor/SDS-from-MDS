Carbon particles indicatethe exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit.
And there are otherways to tell a fire was accidental.
A psychologist's study found economic and even aesthetic reasonswhy some people light woods aflame.
Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have brokenout so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwoodsaid.
``It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average,''said Ron McDonald, Mark Twain's fire control officer.
``It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberatelyset) fires,'' McDonald said.
The tradition seems to stretch across the southern UnitedStates, according to Smallwood.
``I consider myself an Ozarkhillbilly,'' he said.
``Part of it is tradition,'' Smallwood said.
Over the years, timber has been touted as a cash crop that is asworthy of protection as grassland.

``They just happened to be drivingthrough an area they thought needed to be burned out.''
Still, the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simplymisguided citizen.
``Part of the problem is people driving around drinking andshooting road signs,'' Smallwood said.
``When they get bored withthat, they set fires.

They could be mad at government, period.''
Then, ``fire is used as retaliation.''
``It's so senseless,'' he said.
``It just costs a lot of moneyto put these fires out and it's coming right out of our taxdollars.''
In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to beput on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fireand replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said.
Last year,a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the ForestService.
No.1, you usually don't have any witnesses.''
``We had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arsonfire,'' Smallwood said, referring to a 1976 blaze.
And I would have also liked to have known if the prosecutor wouldhave considered a manslaughter charge against the arsonist.

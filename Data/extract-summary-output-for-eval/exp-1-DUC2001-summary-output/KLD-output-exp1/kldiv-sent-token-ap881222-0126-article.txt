The Pentagon said the pilot might have ejected safely.
Another A-10 crashed Dec. 8 in Tracy, Ariz. Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, originally identifiedthe plane as an A-10 aircraft from the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing atRAF Bentwaters, England.
Howard said the plane ``crashed at 9:53 a.m. EST about four milessouth of St. Ives, or about 25 miles north of Cambridge.''
``The pilot ejected and his chute was sighted but we don't knowhis status,'' Howard said.
The aircraft was carrying ``dummy bombs and practice 33mmammunition,'' the spokesman said.
He said he had no information about damage on the ground.
The Thunderbolt II is also one of the safest planes,statistically, in the Air Force inventory.
On the same day as the crash in Remscheid, an A-10 crashed nearthe heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, about 80 mileswest of Tuscon, but the pilot ejected safely.
The plane is no longer in production, but theAir Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.
Statistically, the A-10 over time has been the safest fighter orattack plane currently in the inventory.
The aircraft has excellent maneuverability at lowair speeds and altitude and highly accurate weapons delivery.

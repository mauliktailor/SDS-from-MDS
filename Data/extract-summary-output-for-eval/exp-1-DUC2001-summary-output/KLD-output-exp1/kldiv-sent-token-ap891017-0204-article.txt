``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake.
Allen said this information should have alertedofficials to take preventive steps.
A reading of 6 can cause severe damage.
A quake of 7magnitude, a ``major'' earthquake, is capable of widespread heavydamage.
Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday'squake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.
``It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is acalamitous event.
It's something we should therefore be readyfor,'' Allen said.
The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind ofstructures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the LosAngeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.
``I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of viewfrom this earthquake,'' he said.
``What will be important is to seehow the modern structures behaved.''
In addition, some of the roadways andoverpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of constructionas the Bay Bridge.
In some areas of Southern California, there is a higherprobability of a major quake occurring.

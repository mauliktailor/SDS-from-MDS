Introduction:Hurricane activity off the U.S. East Coast will intensify,warned a weather researcher who reported a new method forpredicting Atlantic tropical storms.
Based on the new findings, Mr. Gray predicted earlier thissummer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be aboveaverage, and so far he seems to be right.
In July he saidthere would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of whichsix would be hurricanes.
A sharp decrease inhurricane activity over the past two decades spurred businessand residential development that would be vulnerable toincreased hurricane activity.
Atlantic hurricanes form from especially strongtropical storms that are triggered by winds and other airdisturbances that sweep across Africa.
From 1947 to 1969, forinstance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especiallyabundant, and during this time there were 13 severehurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
From 1970 to1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, andhurricane activity was unusually low; only one severehurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area.
He found that the Sahel was especially wet from1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935.
Hurricane activity wasmuch higher during this time than during intervals when theSahel was dry.
Mr. Gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, theSahel is entering a wet period.
He said the droughtconditions ended in 1988 and 1989.
He based his 1990 stormforecast on the higher-than-normal rainfall in the Sahel inJuly.

Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek insouthwestern New Mexico, put in containers on mules and horses,loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.
The trout will stay there until the creek rises and becomesash-free.

Gila trout once were widespread throughout mountain streams inthe Gila River Basin of southwestern New Mexico, but the habitat wasruined because of wood cutting, overgrazing and irrigation.
Thetrout was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1967.

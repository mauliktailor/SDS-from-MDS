A.C. Roper, aspokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in Saudi Arabia.
``They have not identified any common cause or commoncontributing factors'' to the recent accidents, he added.
However, suspension oftraining flights indicated otherwise.
Williams said the Air Force gave its pilots in the gulf ``safetyawareness'' briefings during the flight ban in order ``to reviewwhat they need to do to fly more safely.''
Aircraft on operational missions were not grounded, said Col.Miguel Monteverde, another Pentagon spokesman.
Those includedreconnaissance aircraft, refueling tanker planes and F-15 jetspatrolling areas near the Kuwait or Iraqi borders.
He said pilotsof those planes received special safety briefings but their flightschedules were not changed.
As a result,he said, he could not compare the accident rate with that ofprevious deployments.
Williams said the Air Force was the only service that has takenspecial measures to review safety in the gulf since this week'saccidents.
``They're concerned about the accidents, they're concerned aboutthe number of accidents that happened so quickly over a shortperiod of time,'' he told reporters.
He said, however, that the military's safety record in DesertShield remained good.
Also, a C-5 transport plane crashed inWest Germany while ferrying equipment to Saudi Arabia.
Also, 20 other aircraft have been involved in non-fatalaccidents in the gulf area, Williams said.

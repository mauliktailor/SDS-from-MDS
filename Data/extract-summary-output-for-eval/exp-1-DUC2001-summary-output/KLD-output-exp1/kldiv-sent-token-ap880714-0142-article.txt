The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expectedto diminish.
Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the GreatLakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency'sClimate Analysis Center reported.
A 30-day weather forecast issued Wednesday held little hope forimprovement.
And a separate climate assessment added that manyareas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percentchance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation wasundergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.
The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloudover that assumption.
The drought region now extends well into West Virginia andincludes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky andTennessee, the weather service drought advisory said.
On the otherhand, western portions of the Mississippi Valley have received somerelief due to recent rains.
The drought has been accompanied by higher than normaltemperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the westernGreat Lakes region.
Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward fromTexas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.

Mr. Barroargues that as one should have confidence in the wisdom ofconsumers, so one should, when dealing with the electoralprocess, "have similar confidence in the public."
As it was, tradition dictated"rotation in office," and the need to spell out such arestriction was deemed unnecessary.
With 95% re-electionrates, times have changed.
To have microphonespushed in your face every day and to be asked your opinion oneverything under the sun is a corrupting influence.
Soon youstart thinking your opinion is more important than it reallyis and, worse, that perhaps you should codify your opinion oneverything under the sun.
Such individuals arethe last ones we should want passing laws governing the restof us.
What Congress needs is experience in living in thereal world, not in passing legislation.
They opt not to run.
With six-year limits in the House (which most term-limitinitiatives are now proposing for state congressionaldelegations), such individuals would recognize that theywould immediately be on a par with their colleagues inCongress and that they would not have to give up theirproductive careers in the private sector in order to serve.
Indeed, a true citizen Congress would consist of legislatorswho view their time there as essentially a leave of absencefrom their real jobs.

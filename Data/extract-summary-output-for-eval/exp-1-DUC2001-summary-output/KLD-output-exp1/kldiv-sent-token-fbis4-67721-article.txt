The total number of tuberculosis cases in 1993 was 868, while in the 1992 -- it was 771.
In November of the past year, the Department of Health of the Ministry of Welfare submitted a medical legislative proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers, which would require infectious cases of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment, explained I. Pavlovska.
To this day, the proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers has still not been reviewed.
At present, Latvia has 11 state tuberculosis hospitals, providing treatment for tuberculosis cases free of charge.
The newest of these -- Ceplisi (in Ogre rayon), only started operations in January of this year.

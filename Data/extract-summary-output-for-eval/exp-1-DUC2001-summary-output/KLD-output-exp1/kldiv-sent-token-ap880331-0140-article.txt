Introduction: Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced thebeginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from Aprilthrough June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in thenation's heartland.
From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118tornadoes in Texas per year, according to the state climatologist'soffice in College Station.
More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June,records show.
In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoesoccur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the mostunstable, that average increases to about 36.
``People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes.
``A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm.
No matter howmuch preparation you do there is some property damage and some lossof life.
One is to know the difference between the tornado watches andtornado warnings issued by the weather service.
A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development ofa tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potentialfunnel clouds.
James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for DisasterResearch at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly tryto outrun tornadoes in their cars.
During the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado that killed 53, McDonaldsaid, ``people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at90 mph.''
Twenty-six people died while trying to outrun the twister.
Another misconception is about opening windows.

Introduction: Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesdaythat national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic goldmedal for using drugs to enhance his performance.
``I feel terribly sad for him,'' said Fergus Kilmartin, 36, ofCoquitlam, British Colombia.
``I don't believe he did it onpurpose.
He hasn't got the guile to do that.''
``It puts a dent in Canada,'' said Scott Shaw, a 10th gradestudent in Calgary, Alberta, said Tuesday.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who had thanked the Jamaican-bornrunner for the ``thrill of a lifetime'' after his record-breaking9.79-second performance Saturday, called the drug scandal ``amoment of great sorrow for all Canadians.''
``If you could cuthim into a million pieces and test him over again _ my brother isnot on drugs.''
Outside the townhouse, police were called in to control thecrowd and the traffic.
Throughout Monday evening, local childrenattempted to raise a chorus of ``Ben!
Ben!
Ben!''
only to give upwhen the crowd would not respond.
Some Canadian athletes expressed sympathy for Johnson.
Ben does not do drugs.
He did not knowingly do this.''
Charest acknowledged that it was suggested to him several monthsago that Johnson might be using steroids.
``From time to time people would come to me in a private way _ and this happened one or two times ... that maybe Ben Johnson isusing steroids or other drugs,'' he said.
Johnson was last tested in Canada in February at a Montreallaboratory.
``Everybody knew in advance that Mr. Johnson, if he wins amedal, was going to be tested,'' said Charest.

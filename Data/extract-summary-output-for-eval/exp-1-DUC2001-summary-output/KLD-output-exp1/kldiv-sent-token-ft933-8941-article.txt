Introduction: INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the RiverLimpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominatesthe diamond business, discovered but then let get away.
The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government aboutmarketing the diamonds.
The government insists that all minerals are soldthrough its state-controlled Minerals Marketing Corporation.
(A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a sitebefore it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that RiverRanch had been bulldozed.
The increase will be reached in two phases.
The first, costing USDollars2.1m, will raise output to 180,000 carats next year, while the second willcost Dollars 8.7m.
The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy andmove a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZCorporation's diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.
But as Mr Baxter-Brownpointed out: '330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.

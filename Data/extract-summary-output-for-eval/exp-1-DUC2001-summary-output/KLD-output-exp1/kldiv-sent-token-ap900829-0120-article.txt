The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron fromTravis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-MeinAir Base near Frankfurt, authorities said.
Twisted chunks of wings, landing gear, fuselage and other debriswere scattered over a wide area.
Firefighters were still dousingsmoldering sections of wreckage 12 hours after the crash.
The weather was hazy but visibility was about one mile, saidSwope.
He said the aircraft was just over 20 years old, which he saidis not uncommon for the C-5.
The accident occurred about six miles from Miesau, where U.S.military authorities have been removing a cache of chemical weaponsunder an agreement with the West German government.
It was the first crash of a C-5 in 15 years.

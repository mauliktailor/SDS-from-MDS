Introduction:   Less than a month before elections, theassassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombiato the brink of political chaos.
After the shooting of candidate Carlos Pizarro in a jetlinerThursday, the country's largest newspaper implored the governmentto ``do something, for the love of God.''
Four of his predecessorshave been assassinated.
In recent interviews, Pizarro, the candidate for the leftistApril 19 Movement, or M-19, admitted he was afraid.
A gunman on a suicide mission shot Pizarro aboard a Colombianjetliner after it took off from Bogota's airport.
Pizarro'sbodyguards shot and killed the assassin.
Two other presidential candidates had already been assassinatedduring the campaign for May 27 elections.
Authorities blamed the assassinations on drug traffickers.
The media, citing security sources, reported that traffickerswere the main suspects in Pizarro's killing as well.
On Saturday Antonio Navarro, a longtime guerrilla leader of theApril 19 Movement, announced he would take Pizarro's place ascandidate for president.
For the first time, leading politicians suggested the governmentitself might be compromised by the killing.
Several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin couldnot have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity ofgovernment and airport security personnel.
Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of threecandidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must bereorganized.
Official investigations have shown that certain members of thearmed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country'sright-wing death squads.
He suggested that Barco had lost control over the armed forces.
Barco, of the Liberal Party, rejected Gomez's suggestion of atriumvirate, saying the armed forces would be reorganized only ifnecessary.
The unit achieved its greatest success against drug traffickerswhen it killed a Medellin cartel leader, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,in a gunfight last December.

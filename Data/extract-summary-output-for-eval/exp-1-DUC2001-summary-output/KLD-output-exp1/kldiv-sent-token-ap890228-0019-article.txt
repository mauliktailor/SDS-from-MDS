Introduction: The earthquake that killed 25,000 people inArmenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwideto the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed atleast 10 times as many, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.
Although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about10,000, in 1987 only 1,100 lives were lost.
Thedeath toll of 25,000 is the most recent reported by the Soviets.
The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by anearthquake.
An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, andthe strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.
Last year's second most deadly earthquake occurred Aug. 20 on theNepal-India border, killing 1,000.
That earthquake, measuring 6.6 onthe Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured manypeople.
On Nov. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma andChina, the Geological Survey reported.
6 earthquake that caused landslides.
The Survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year,15 fewer than the year before.
An earthquake is consideredsignificant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale.
Earthquakes of lesser magnitude are included if they causecasualties or considerable damage.
It was measured at 4.6 on thescale and caused some injuries and property damage.
It had a magnitude of5.7.
Injuries were also reported from two offshore earthquakes, one inthe Ionian Sea near Greece Oct. 16 and another near the AzoresIslands Nov. 21.
In Africa, eight people working in a gold mine in South Africadied Jan. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2.
And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only onesignificant earthquake last year, the Survey reported.

After a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster,both the president and his administration seem finally to be gettingassistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that havebeen destroyed.
This was brought home graphically by the president'sannouncement that Homestead Air Force base in Florida - a major localemployer virtually destroyed by Andrew  - would be rebuilt.
His poignant and brief address to the nation on Tuesday night, committingthe government to pay the emergency relief costs and calling on Americans tocontribute to the American Red Cross, also struck the right sort of note.
Itwas only his tenth such televised speech from the Oval Office, itself atestimony to the gravity of the situation.
First responses were certainly found wanting, specifically in theperformance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) set up byPresident Carter in 1979 to handle disasters such as Andrew.
FEMA has, underthe Republicans, become the ultimate patronage backwater, with, according toone congressional study, ten times as many political appointees as thetypical arm of government.
It was Mr Baker who reshuffled the president's campaign schedule to makeroom for visits to the devastated areas and who pushed for a bigger role forthe previously obscure Mr Card.
Both are, ofcourse, intensely political actions.
But both may be presented by a president as being in thenational interest because they guarantee employment, which is what theelection is largely about.
US insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result ofdamage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana, the American InsuranceServices Group said yesterday, Nikki Tait reports.
This takes the insurancebill from the storm to around Dollars 8bn, making it the costliest disasterto hit the US.

The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out ofthe 218 needed.
It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants areason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it ispushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around.
Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few daysbefore the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to getthe remaining 8 votes.
However the anti-Nafta forces expect a different outcome.
They count 190-200Democrats against, 10-15 Democrats leaning against, and 5-10 Republicansopposed.
The pro-Nafta campaign this week began moving into high gear.
Members of the cabinet are being sent to congressional districts, where theyvisit and publicise factories that are expected to gain jobs if Naftapasses.
The speakers were workers who had lost theirjobs when their employers moved to Mexico.

Introduction:   ``Mad cow disease'' has killed 10,000 cattle,restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry andraised fears about the safety of eating beef.
``But theycertainly are not zero.
I have not changed my eating habits, but Icertainly do wonder.''
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE,was diagnosed only in 1986.
The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed inJune 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen,thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.
Sheep offalis still used in pig and poultry feed.
The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said.
``In thecourse of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quitenormal to very vicious and totally disoriented.''
As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodsaid that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosedwith BSE.
The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and isbudgeting $16 million for 1990.
Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 caseshave been confirmed there, all of them near the border with theBritish province of Northern Ireland.
The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause ofthe disease.
The report said the disease was impossible to detect inapparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immunesystem to produce antibodies.
The Southwood report said it was ``most unlikely'' that thedisease was a threat to humans.
But the report added: ``If ourassessments of these likelihoods are incorrect, the implicationswould be extremely serious.''
About two dozen cases were reported inBritain last year.
Another form, known as kuru, had been found cannibals in NewGuinea.

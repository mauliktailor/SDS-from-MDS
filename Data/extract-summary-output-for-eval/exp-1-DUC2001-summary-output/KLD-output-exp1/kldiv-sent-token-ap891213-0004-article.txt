The thirdstory in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,''examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmersmost in need.
But for this farmer and others, itwas a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give itaway with the other.
``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindbergsaid.
``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray andchemicals and tires, they got paid.
What I'm saying is, the farmergot the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.''
The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; manysay it also kept the state afloat.
It was the major source of income for most farmers.''
``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and boughtCadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' Grindberg added.
``Everyone in NorthDakota in some way or another was helped.''
More than 49,000 producers shared $410.2million _ about 10.5 percent of the total package.
Almost all wasfor crop loss.
The state, the No.
Another university survey of 466 farmers said that withoutdrought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have beenjust $6,300.
Drought payments added $15,000.
The five states together received nearly half theassistance allocated nationwide.
Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million intoIowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.
``From '81 through '86, the bottom pretty much fell out ofeverything,'' said Greg Schulz, who farms about five miles fromGrindberg.
``Financial aid helpsto alleviate that.
In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $530million, Aakre said.
Cass County also had a better 1989 crop but expects higherlosses in crop dollars.
And while virtually all farmers herereceived government aid in 1988, far fewer will be eligible asecond time.
About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farmsin Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres.
Wheat, corn,barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grownhere.
That's all I had really hopedfor.''
At least they have a commodityto sell.
We might not.''
... Last year we had abreak-even type of year.
This year it was break-even.
Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley,was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance.
Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mailpart-time, thinks the government last year ``pushed he panic buttonon this disaster thing and went too far.
In '89, they went too farthe other way I think.''
``Disaster aid is political,'' he said.
``Depending on when youhave the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not.
But Grindberg will persist.
``As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, ``next year'salways the best year.

The president said he would focus on better implementation of the FamilySupport Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-forcewhich he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
With the onset of the recession, state revenues have been constrained whilethe number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent.
Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principlethat 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'.
There must be'a certain time beyond which people don't draw a cheque for doing nothing,'he said.
But at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trapby providing them with continued health coverage, child care, and expandedearned income tax credits when they took jobs.
Mr Clinton said he would let states experimentwith such programmes, even when he disagreed with them.

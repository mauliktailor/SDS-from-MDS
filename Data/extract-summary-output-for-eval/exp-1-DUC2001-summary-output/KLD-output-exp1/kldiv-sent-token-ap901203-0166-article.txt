Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.``We're not backing the prediction at all.''
``There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely,'' saidPerson, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than25 years.
``There are no two earthquakes alike.''
That's wherethey conduct those tests.''
``That's not atest,'' he said.
Quick calculations showed the quake wasmagnitude 3.5, centered about 30 miles southwest of Ely, Nev.
Between midnight and evening, four moderate quakes were recordedat Golden.
About 800 quakes between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9 are recorded eachyear, said USGS spokesman Don Finley in Washington.
The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by anearthquake.
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,6 severe damage.
The big San Francisco Bay area quake last yearregistered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, witha magnitude 1 or higher, Person said.
This fall, there have been two in the New Madrid Fault area,magnitude 4.6 on Sept. 26 and magnitude 3.5 on Nov. 9, which ``isnot unusual,'' he said.
Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecastingthem is difficult, if not impossible, Person said.
Over the years, he has heard countless earthquake predictions.
The job, he confesses, ``is never boring.

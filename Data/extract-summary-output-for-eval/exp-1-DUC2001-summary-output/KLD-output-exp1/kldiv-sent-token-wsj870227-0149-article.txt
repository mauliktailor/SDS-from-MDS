Introduction: While there is agreement in virtually every quarter that something needs to be done about welfare, disagreement remains over exactly what to do.
Moynihan and Kennedy.
Meeting this week in Washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system.
The leaders of the National Governors Association came away from a White House meeting this past Tuesday pleasantly surprised that they were able to reach an accord with the president on many points.
The conference's chairman, Democratic Gov.
That is not to say the president agreed with the governors on every count.
The most unattractive feature of the governors' welfare plan is its price tag -- up to $2 billion a year on top of the $100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs.
However committed the administration and Congress may be to reform, they're unlikely to endorse a plan that increases the deficit.
But taxpayers can be forgiven if they view this part of the governors' argument with skepticism.
Oversold political programs and promises are largely what got us into this mess.
Nonetheless there is merit in the governors' plan, as there is in the administration's reform proposals, and in the reform bills under consideration in the Senate.
The degree of consensus forming around welfare reform is unusual.
All the important players -- the president, the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve, in the president's words, "real and lasting emancipation" from welfare dependency.
On this point, at least, there doesn't seem to be much conflict.
Since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action.

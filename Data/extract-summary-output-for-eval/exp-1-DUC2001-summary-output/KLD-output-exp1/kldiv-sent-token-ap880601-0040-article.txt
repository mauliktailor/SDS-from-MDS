Introduction: A study has found that the U.S. deathtoll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previouslypredicted, the head of the National Hurricane Center said Tuesdayto mark the opening of the 1988 Atlantic storm season.
Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for theAtlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlierthought must be evacuated under certain conditions, said centerdirector Bob Sheets.
During a hurricane that struck Houston, ``glass was flyingeverywhere,'' said Sheets.
The first tropical depression of the year has formed, andremained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip ofCuba, or about 200 miles southwest of Havana.
The system containedwinds of up to 30 mph and was not expected to strengthen.
``It's quite possible this year that we could lose GOES-West atanytime,'' hurricane specialist Bob Case said of the Geo-StationaryEarth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which records atmosphericconditions over the Pacific Ocean and part of the WesternHemisphere.
A previous GOES-East expired in 1984 and temporarily deprivedmeteorologists of Atlantic atmospheric photographs.
In 1987 there were only three hurricanes and four tropicalstorms in the Atlantic.
``Emily was the fastest moving hurricane of any known in thiscentury,'' Case said.
Hurricane Arlene meandered through the Atlantic in mid-Augustwith top wind of 75 mph.
Hurricane Floyd hit Key West with 75 mphwind but fizzled out over the Everglades and Miami in mid-October.

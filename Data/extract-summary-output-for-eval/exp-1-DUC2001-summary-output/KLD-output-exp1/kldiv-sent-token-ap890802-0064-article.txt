Introduction: A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census isresolved with the decision to include military personnel stationedoverseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep countingillegal aliens.
The national head count will be taken April 1, 1990.
Censusfigures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among thestates every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to localgovernments.
The Commerce Department settled that problem by announcing itwill work with the Defense Department on ways to count the 1.2million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers wholive overseas.
That has yet to be decided, but possibilitiesinclude counting the state where the person owns a home or the laststate where he or she lived for at least six months.
The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both incommittee and on the House floor.
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban oncounting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 millionto run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year,including $800 million to take the census.
The bill was approved258-165 and sent to the Senate.
The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget forthe census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegalaliens, he said.
Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really overpopulation shifts that will lead to more House seats for southernand western states.
``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go downto the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose aseat,'' said Dymally.
Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., said, however, that counting illegalaliens ``is not fair.
It may be constitutional, but it's just notright.''

Introduction:Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls.
Students of government like me find it hard to understand why.
Quite the contrary.
Forcing senior members of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the veterans already have.
This will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it.
Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment.
People need time to learn their jobs.
New people in any complex institution are highly dependent on the people around them.
Why do we assume that new blood is automatically better than old?
Of course we should pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those whose performance we find wanting.
It is hard to see how restricting voters' alternatives in this arbitrary way can be proposed in the name of representative government or of democracy.
One must conclude that other forces are at work.

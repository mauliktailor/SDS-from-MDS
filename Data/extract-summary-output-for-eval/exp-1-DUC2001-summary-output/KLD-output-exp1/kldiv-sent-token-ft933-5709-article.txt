But he comes to Washington well prepared for thekind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade adivided Congress to pass it.
Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother,45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator withimportant connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organisedlabour.
He has never run for political office.
With the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified byJanuary 1, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, andvisible.
Bill Daley is no Washington neophyte.
Opposition to Nafta comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it apotential political pothole for Mr Clinton.
However, Mr Rostenkowski is under investigation for improper useof his post office perks and faces an uneasy future.
His Chicago-style back-room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to thepublic tactics of Nafta's most prominent opponent, Mr Ross Perot.
'It is a very interesting juxtaposition of styles,' says Chicago politicalcommentator Mr Bruce DuMont. '
Bill Daley is like a Stealth bomber.
'Mr Daley has taken four months out from his Chicago law firm to lead theNafta push.
He recently rejoined the firm after a three-year stint aspresident of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, which was founded by theAmalgamated Textile Workers union in 1922.
Although it passed into privateownership in 1966, its board is still dominated by high-profile unionofficials.
Mr Jim Jontz, former congressman from Indiana and director ofthe anti-Nafta Citizen's Trade Campaign, said: 'I don't know why Bill Daleywould want to be in a position like that.
It's just wrong.

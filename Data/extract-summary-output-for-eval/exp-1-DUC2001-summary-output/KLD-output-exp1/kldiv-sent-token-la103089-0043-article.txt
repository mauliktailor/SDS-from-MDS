Introduction: Mother Nature conspired against this struggling marathon Sunday, serving up balmy, windy weather and wilting both the men's and women's fields.
Temperatures during the Old Style/Chicago marathon hovered in the mid-60s, with 53% humidity.
Most distance runners prefer temperatures in the 40s, with cloud cover.
That developed, at points, Sunday, as about 8,000 runners started at Daley Plaza downtown and wended their way through city streets.
Those early leaders: El-Mostafa Nechchadi of Morocco, Don Janicki of Colorado, Gerardo Alcala of Mexico, Carlos Montero of Spain and Gabriel Kamau of Kenya.
No one who was in the lead pack at the halfway point, with the exception of Montero, finished in the top five.
Davies-Hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race favorite Steve Binns, who lives 30 miles from Davies-Hale in England's West Midlands.
Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37.
Ed Eyestone was the first U.S. finisher in fourth, 2:14:57.
With reason.
Then, the heat from the sun and the perceptible heat of Weidenbach constantly gaining did her in.
At 18 miles, Weidenbach came up on O'Brien, her New Balance teammate.
It was also where dozens of her family members and friends were posted.
Carla Beurskens of the Netherlands, at 37 still an amazing runner, eventually passed the struggling O'Brien and placed second 2:30:24.
O'Brien was third in 2:31:19.
Given the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach's time might have been as much as two minutes faster.
Even the 2:28 is respectable -- only five U.S. women have run under 2:30.

Still, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is.

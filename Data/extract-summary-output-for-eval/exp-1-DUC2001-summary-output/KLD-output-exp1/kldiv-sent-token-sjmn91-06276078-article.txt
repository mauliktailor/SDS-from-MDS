Introduction: A CEO sneezes in his corporate suite.
The next day, thejanitor is sick with the same flu the CEO had.
What's the link?
"Modern office buildings are tight,"says Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California's occupational healthprogram. "
In order to conserve energy, they're often sealed.
But as in "sick building syndrome," it's the airtight environment that setsthe stage for problems.
If ithas a good ventilation system .
.
.
you don't necessarily have to have a sickbuilding," Rosenberg says.
"The building is notthe source.
"Verybad ventilation makes the system worse.
"If tuberculosis can spread in poorly ventilated buildings, socan other infectious bugs.
Respiratory infection experts say that flu virusesand measles are easier to spread than TB.
In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor airventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubicfeet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings wheresmoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infectedwith tuberculosis.
Flu spreads muchmore easily than TB.
If the ventilation is moderatelyeffective but not ideal, further improvements yield only a slight decrease ininfectious illness.
"There's only so much you can do," Nardell says.

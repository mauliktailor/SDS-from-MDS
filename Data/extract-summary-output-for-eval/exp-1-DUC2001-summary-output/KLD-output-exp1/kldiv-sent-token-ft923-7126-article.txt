Introduction:IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds byminers in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business isin turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of theworld's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market.
In Canada's Northwest Territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, someof gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in thehistory of the North American industry.
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large andprospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) ofthe discovery.
In spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone willfind enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada's first diamondmine worthwhile.
The odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamondhunters in Angola.
More than Dollars 1m-worth of gem diamonds a day arebeing smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.
As well as experienced miners, many soldiers who could not find civilianjobs have made their way to the diamond areas.
Did Unita, Angola'srebel movement, build up a stockpile which is now being released?
IsEndiama, Angola's state-owned diamond company, implicated in some way?
Inthe murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound.
What is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in Angolaor dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in Canada take it forgranted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices upand make all their efforts worthwhile.
The cartel has survived partly because nobody needs diamonds.
They arecomposed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes intough material, but there are substitutes for this use.
But the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risensteadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recessionthe price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retailmarket from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 10,000.The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central SellingOrganisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.
it will probably have to cutits annual dividend payment for the first time since 1981.
It has also toldthe producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent - something the CSO contractspermit at times of stress.
The contents are judged by the CSO to balance therequirements of the buyers with market demand.
Buyers have either to acceptall the diamonds or reject the box.
In bad times like this, I sometimes wishthat we could.
The fact is that the level of world diamond production, whichis carried on in many countries, cannot be controlled.
Diamond prices cannotbe fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows productionand consumption to be equated.
In this way it has been able topreserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimateluxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors andconsumers of this unique natural product.
'All very altruistic.
The cartel nearly lost control of the market in the early 1980s.
The CSO'sdiamond stocks, worth under Dollars 1bn in 1980 rose to Dollars 1.9bn by1984.
After the bust came boom.
Underlying the boom was phenomenal growth in demandfor diamonds in Japan where lack of living space encourages people todisplay their wealth by buying small but expensive items.
The CSO boostedthe trend with clever promotion so that today diamond engagement rings areregularly exchanged in Japan whereas forthcoming marriages traditionallywere celebrated over a cup of rice wine.
It must be open to question whether another Japan can be found to lift thediamond market as the present recession ends.
'By mopping up Angolan supplies we can say that more of the world's roughdiamonds are passing through the CSO than ever before,' he says. '
Last year Namibian output reached1.19m carats, up from 750,000.

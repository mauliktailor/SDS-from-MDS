Introduction:Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on an 8,200-acre brush fire in Cleveland National Forest that destroyed 11 structures near Lake Elsinore in Riverside County.
Aided by higher humidity and a decrease in wind, fire crews had more than 85% of the blaze surrounded late Friday afternoon and began releasing many of the 2,300 people who had been fighting the fire.
Officials predicted that the blaze would be completely under control by Saturday morning but would not be extinguished until midday Sunday.
2,000 Acres Burned Meanwhile, a brush fire that burned more than 2,000 acres of mostly rugged terrain in the Antelope Valley this week was contained by firefighters Friday morning, authorities said.
Authorities estimated that fighting the fire near Lake Elsinore will wind up costing $1.5 million.
Although officials first believed that the fire would be contained by late Friday afternoon, they revised their estimates because of troubles battling lingering flames on the southern edge of the blaze, inside the rugged, 3,400-acre San Mateo Wilderness.
Four firefighters were injured fighting the blaze, one of them seriously, authorities said.
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Robert Brady said the Antelope Valley fire was 100% contained at 8 a.m. Friday.
Home Burned The fire claimed 2,250 acres along the outskirts of Elizabeth Lake and Green Valley.
More than 300 firefighters battled the blaze during the three days.
Brady said there were no injuries reported.

Introduction: In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count.
Just before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against killing the proposal to bar aliens from the count.
A Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped from a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce departments.
Loss of Seats Cited "Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens," Dole argued.
Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.)
"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran said.
For 190 years, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the federal government has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in accordance with the Constitution's provisions.
"Fiddling with the numbers" now will destroy confidence in the census results, he added.
Mario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was shocked by the Senate's decision.
"It is going to have a dramatic and disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," Moreno said.
"People are going to be discouraged from participating."
A Census Bureau spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however.

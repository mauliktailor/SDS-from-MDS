Introduction: The chairman of the House Agriculture Committeesays hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Servicehandled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West,including one-third of Yellowstone National Park.
``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area,you speak to two and you get three opinions,'' says Rep. Kika de laGarza, a Texas Democrat.
``The best thing to do is to sit down andhave them all put it on the record and then sift through whathappened and see if anything needs to be done.''
The hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitationof charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summerfires, said a subcommittee staff member.
The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300million fighting the summer fires, the Forest Service said.
The mostsevere were in and around Yellowstone and Alaska, although therewere fires in the South, California and the Pacific Northwest.
Drought conditions, high winds and a ``tremendous build-up'' oftinder, in Yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988 fires theworst in a hundred years, officials said.

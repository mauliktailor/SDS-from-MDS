Introduction: THE US administration has given the go-ahead for pilot plans to reformwelfare benefits in Wisconsin and Georgia that could serve as experimentsfor the broader overhaul of the welfare system promised by President BillClinton.
The Wisconsin plan would cut off cash payments under the principal welfareprogramme, known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, after twoyears, although it would continue to provide food stamps and healthcoverage.
The promise to 'end welfare as we know it' was an important theme in MrClinton's election campaign.
Although he named a welfare reform task forcein June, the reform has been held up by delays in passing the budget and isnow expected to be delayed until the ambitious reform of the healthcaresystem has passed Congress.

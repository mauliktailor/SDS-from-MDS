> St. Martin's, 306 pp., $18.95CHARLIE Francis, testifying in 1988 in Torontoat a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports,seemed a mad scientist, something on the order of Dr. Frankenstein.
And although he spoke of his athletes as if theywere family members, too, he made it plain, under oath, that he had given themevery steroid combination imaginable, his experiments all carefullycalibrated, charted and analyzed.
His system had worked remarkably.
OnSept.
The time was a world record and gaveJohnson the gold medal, ahead of the defending champion, U.S. star CarlLewis.
But the Francis system, like all systems, was not foolproof. "
"Johnson, theworld's fastest man, had tested positive for illegal steroid use.
Suddenly hewas the world's fastest cheat.
Millions of dollars worth of endorsementsshriveled up.
His gold medal was revoked, and his world record was, too.
Because Johnson was caught, the Canadians were embarrassed.
Because they wereembarrassed, they conducted a federal inquiry.
He argues,essentially, that to be a world-class sprinter, you must use steroids -- hemakes this argument even as Johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 OlympicGames in Barcelona, Spain, without them.
The desirefor speed comes with incredible costs, and they are the trap.
By encouraginghis athletes to use steroids -- and Francis maintains that they all wanted todo so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up --Francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field.
We learn that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is nothing new in theworld of sports -- that cocaine and arsenic and codeine were used by athletesin the 1896 Olympic Games.
We learn that Johnson harmed his own world-recordtimes by raising his hand jubilantly as he approached the finish line.
Welearn that if athletes take steroids on their own, independent of an official(but still illicit, of course) program, it's called "free-lancing."
After all, he had neverbeen caught before.
No one of Johnson's standing had been caught before.
For all its candor, answers and revelations are not forthcoming in "SpeedTrap."
Thebook lacks a strong sense of character development.
It does not take any moralstand; it lacks passion.
What drovehim?
The early word is that he is stillextremely fast, probably one of the fastest men in the world -- but no longerthe fastest.
(Johnson disagrees.
People who want running to be a"natural" sport are naive.
"It is a formidablechallenge to distinguish between nature and artifice, a task I would leave tothe philosophers.
"But "Speed Trap" left me wishing Francis had at leasttried his hand at philosophy.
Isn't that everyone's responsibility?
To ask whywe do the things we do? "
But I was a sprint coach, and I had a different job,"he concludes.
"To help a few gifted people run as fast as they could.
"They ran fast, all right.
But he never seems to have asked himself: Is itworth it?

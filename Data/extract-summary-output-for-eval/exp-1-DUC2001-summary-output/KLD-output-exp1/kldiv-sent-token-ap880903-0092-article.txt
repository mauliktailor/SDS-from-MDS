``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president saidin a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20miles north of here.
Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of hisadministration's economic record, saying Friday's unemploymentfigures showed that the jobless rate ``hovered just above thelowest it's been in 14 years.''
The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6percent, up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3per cent, which was a 14-year low.
To deal with this, he said, his administration launched aprogram encouraging states to come up with their own plans to getpeople off the welfare rolls.
``Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposedwidespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good oldcommon sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work,'' thepresident said.
``I will notaccept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making peopleindependent of welfare.''
A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it aSenate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and aHouse-approved measure that does not.
``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,''the president said.
``If Congress presents me with a bill thatreplaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity ofself-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans onwelfare, I will use my veto pen.''

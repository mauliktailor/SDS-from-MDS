Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blazethat raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park inCalifornia over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-dayfire in Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Mondayafter the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.
About a quarter-inch of rain helped to keep the lightning-causedShoshone fire's growth to about 200 acres overnight, said fireinformation officer Dave Damron.
Crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air,Damron said, as four helicopters and three air tankers droppedchemical retardant and water on the spreading flames.
On the groundfirefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers.
The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, nearYosemite, was a ``bottle rocket,'' said the forest's spokeswoman,Mary Hale.
The fire was the largest so far this year in the forest, whichwas the scene of huge wildfires last summer.
Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeksbefore the fire is extinguished.
``It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain,''he said.
The Fourth of July was no holiday for firefighters from nationalforests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho and other states who wereshipped to Michigan's central Upper Peninsula to battle theHiawatha blaze, Bluedorn said.
Forest Service officials, meanwhile, began assessing damage tothe 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlandsburned after the fire broke out Friday afternoon, Bluedorn said.
Investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause.

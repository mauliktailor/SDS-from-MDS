Introduction: This is not an argument regarding the merits of gun control laws.
The Second Amendment was, as was the rest of the first 10 amendments (the Bill of Rights), insisted upon by some of the states for their own protection from the federal government.
The Second Amendment stated one of the subjects about which the federal government was prohibited from making any laws.
The word "people" as used in constitutional law is used collectively and refers to a political entity, such as a state, and does not mean "persons" or individuals.
An early ruling in 1875 in U.S. vs. Cruikshank established the view of the U.S. Supreme Court, upheld in cases in 1886, 1894 and 1939.
There is no national document controlling the states with regard to arms.
The states may regulate arms within their borders.

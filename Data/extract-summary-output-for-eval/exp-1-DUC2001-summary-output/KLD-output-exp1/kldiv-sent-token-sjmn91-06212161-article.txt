Eighty percent of Hispanics over 40who are diagnosed as diabetic are overweight, she said.
Participants will learn that traditional dishes can be just astasty -- but healthier -- when made with unsaturated fats, and that exercisewill reduce weight, which in turn will lower the possibility of contractingdiabetes.
The hospital and the diabetes society are sponsoringneighborhood diabetes programs for Hispanics, which are taught by bilingualinstructors.
The programs, which first began in 1984, are aimed at peoplewho speak only Spanish or people who are more comfortable receivinginstruction in that language.
"We found that the regular programs that westarted years ago were not reaching the monolingual Spanish-speaker," McNamarasaid.

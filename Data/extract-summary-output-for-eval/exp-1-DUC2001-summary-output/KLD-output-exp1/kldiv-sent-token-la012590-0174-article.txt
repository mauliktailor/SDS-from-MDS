Revenue totaled $96.1 billion in 1989, compared to $88.6 billion the year before.
The fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to $880 million that the company already set aside in the first and second quarters, bringing Exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion.
Other costs will be covered by "more than $400 million" in insurance, Smith said.
Analysts were not surprised at the additional charge, though "it was a lot bigger than I expected," said Joel D. Fischer, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
"The financial effect of the Exxon Valdez accident was clearly the major reason for lower net income in 1989," said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement.
The charges from the Valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from a change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in federal tax law.
That raised Exxon's income by $535 million for the year.
The decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing profit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations.
In the fourth quarter, earnings before the Valdez charge were $1.28 billion, compared to $1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter.
Analysts said Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage from the charges.
"I think they did end the year on a strong note, largely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing," said Eugene Nowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
Smith declined to say what costs the new $500-million charge would cover.
The office's operations will be transferred to Midland, Tex.

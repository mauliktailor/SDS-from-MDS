In 1988, the last year for which complete statistics areavailable, 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported, down 0.4percent from 1987, the national Centers for Disease Controlreported Thursday.
That slight drop compares with an average annualdecrease of 6.7 percent from 1981 to 1984.
Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, ascompared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higherrates of AIDS cases.
In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites,compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics.

But the number of new cases is only part of the toll fromtuberculosis, the CDC said.
In 1987, more than 115,000 Americanswere under TB treatment: 20,000 new patients plus 95,000 peoplelabeled high-risk and on preventive therapy.
Tuberculosis, which is curable in most cases with drugtreatment, killed 1,755 Americans in 1987.

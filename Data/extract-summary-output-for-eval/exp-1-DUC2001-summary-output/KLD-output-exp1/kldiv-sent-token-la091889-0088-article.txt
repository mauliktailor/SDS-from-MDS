The figure, contained in the bank's annual report and made public before its annual meeting here Sept. 23, was almost a third larger than in 1987, when the net pay-back totaled $38.3 billion.
The cash drain has been growing steadily since 1984, when it was $10.2 billion.
The figures on the cash drain showed that these "net resource transfers," as the bank parlance terms them, are mushrooming rapidly -- a measure of the mounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on Third World economies.
Sunday's total is approximately $7 billion higher than a preliminary estimate of $43 billion for 1988 that the bank published last December. "
The situation in the Third World is getting worse, not better," a bank official said.
A bank spokesman said that part of the reason that the figure is so bloated is that some countries, such as cash-rich South Korea, are paying off their debts early.
Still, the figure is massive by any measure.
The total debt burden of Third World countries currently is estimated at about $993 billion.
The bank gave a variety of reasons for the disparity in growth rates among developing countries.
In general, however, it said that countries whose governments follow sensible economic policies, such as in East Asia, have attracted heavy new investment and have performed well.
But others, such as those in Latin America, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, that are heavily state-owned economies and consume more than they produce, have not.
In particular, investment has lagged in these countries as residents have sent their capital abroad.
Drain Began in 1984 However, efforts under the Brady plan are going relatively slowly, and World Bank officials cautioned that the results may not show up for at least two or three more years.

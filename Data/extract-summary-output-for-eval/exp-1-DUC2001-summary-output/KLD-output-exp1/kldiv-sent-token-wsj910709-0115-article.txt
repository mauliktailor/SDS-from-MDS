Introduction: Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson.
A question is which lesson his life best demonstrates.
Some say that he is living proof that in America anything ispossible, and that's true, and some note his rise to eminencedemonstrates again the progress we have made as a nation interms of race, and that's true too.
But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendentone: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.
His mother loved him.
He got loveand love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that hehad a place at the table.
This is something we in the age ofthe-family-that-is-not-a-family forget: the raw power of loveand how it is the one essential element in the creation offunctioning and successful people, and how its absence twiststhe psyche and the heart.
Lives like Judge Thomas's remind us of thissimple truth.

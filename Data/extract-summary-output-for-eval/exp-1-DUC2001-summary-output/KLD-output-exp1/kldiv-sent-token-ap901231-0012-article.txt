Introduction:   Mexico, where sun worship has passed fromancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early forthe day next year when the sun will be blotted out.
The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes,the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun,abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on thehorizon.
People from British Columbia to Buenos Aires will experience atleast a partial eclipse.
But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is bankingon the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor.
For three years, scientists and astronomy buffs have beenstaking out turf in Mexico.
It will be the last chance to see atotal solar eclipse this century.
The state says at least four ships will pressed into service asfloating hotels.
Some 13,500 amateur and professional astronomers from the UnitedStates, Japan, Soviet Union, China, Canada, England, France andGermany have confirmed reservations.
Some tourists have been bookedinto one hotel even before it is completed.
At least one expedition plans to view the show from the17,887-foot Popocapetl volcano, the country's second-highest peak.
Others plan to see it from boats at sea.
An eclipse is an astronomical coincidence.
The moon is 400 timessmaller than the sun, but because it is 400 times closer to theearth, the smaller body appears to cover the larger one.
Temperatures will drop at least 5{ degrees.
The stars will comeout; the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter will shine.
Streetlights will be triggered on.

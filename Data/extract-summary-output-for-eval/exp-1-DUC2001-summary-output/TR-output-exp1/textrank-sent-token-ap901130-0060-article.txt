Introduction: The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season had more stormsthan usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of morefrequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years.
Dr. William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at ColoradoState University, thinks a dry spell in West Africa during the pasttwo decades explained the reduction of storms along the easternseaboard in the last 20 years.
In 1988 and 1989, there was near normal rainfall in the Sahel,the semi-arid land on the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert.
Some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end ofa 20-year drought - and may have spawned Gilbert in 1988 and Hugoin 1989.
But Gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlookfor the 1990s and the early years of the next century is for moreintense hurricanes than those of the last two decades.
``We've been through a real long period of hurricane inactivityin the '70s and '80s up until 1985, and I think we're coming out ofthat,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Centerin Coral Gables.
``Perhaps the Gilberts and the Hugos were signaling that ,'' hesaid, recalling Hurricane Gilbert that wracked the Caribbean andHurricane Hugo that devastated South Carolina - two of the mostdestructive Atlantic hurricanes ever.
Hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic every month exceptApril, but are rare outside the hurricane season, June 1 to Nov.30.
While many of the storms spun harmlessly through the Atlantic,several caused their share of destruction.
The most deadly storm was Hurricane Diana, which swept intoMexico in early August, resulting in flash floods and mudslidesthat killed 96 people and caused extensive damage to roads,property and agriculture, the weather service reported.

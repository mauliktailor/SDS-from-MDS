The proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of theRepublican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospectiveDemocratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and mostof the Democratic leadership in Congress.
But the outpouring of public disaffection for 'politics as usual' has pushedto the forefront of many polls in the US election campaign Mr Ross Perot,the Texas billionaire.
His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
The president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of theagreement at the most politically opportune time.
Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executivedirector of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as aweapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs toMexico.
A centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to theCongress in May 1991, in which he committed himself to action onenvironmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.
'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if theydon't send a complete package in these three areas, the CongressionalDemocrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn'tmatter,' said Mr Freeman.
Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared itsground well in the House.
'In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator DonRiegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas.

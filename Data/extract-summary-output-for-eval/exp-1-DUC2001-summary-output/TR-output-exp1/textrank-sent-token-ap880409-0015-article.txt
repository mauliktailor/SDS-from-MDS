Introduction: A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer inthe Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas,but says it's impossible to know if any of the storms will threatenpopulated areas.
William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at ColoradoState University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantichurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but aboveaverage for the decade.
The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of thelast six hurricane seasons.
``It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which doesform in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the averagehurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season,''Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.
But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around theequator and winds for ``El Nino'' periods, when eastern Pacificwaters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of whenor where a hurricane might form.
Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterlywinds at the equator and the approaching end of ``El Nino'' period.
His prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and heoriginally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figureto seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985.
Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantichurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said.
Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conferencestressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during thelull in hurricanes; a surge in storms, up to the levels of the1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.

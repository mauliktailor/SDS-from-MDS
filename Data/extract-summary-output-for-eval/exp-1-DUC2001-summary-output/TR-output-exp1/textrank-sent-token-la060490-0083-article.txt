Introduction:"Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.
On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales.
Despite assurances from the British government that the beef is safe, consumers and some scientists remain skeptical.
British officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of economic, not health, concerns.
The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the "mad cow" scare.
"It's totally unjustified and illegal," said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the Meat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization.
Although other countries have recently placed some restrictions on British beef and cattle, the French and German moves were the strongest by far.
The United States does not import British beef and recently rescinded permits for the importation of live cattle.
Mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since it was first noticed in the mid-1980s.
No one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow's brain.
Some experts believe that cattle contracted the disease as a result of eating food contaminated with the remains of sheep infected with a BSE-like disease called scrapie.
On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died from a disease identical to BSE.
"And until the cat, it hadn't been brought into the home."
Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef.

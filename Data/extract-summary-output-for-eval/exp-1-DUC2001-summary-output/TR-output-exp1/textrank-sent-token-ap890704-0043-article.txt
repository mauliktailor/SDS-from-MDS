Introduction:   Suspected communist rebels todaykilled the police chief of the Philippines' major financial centerin an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area ,police said.
Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had justfinished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when twoassassins opened fire with .45-caliber pistols, police said.
Lydio Zeta quoted witnesses as saying the gunmenshouted ``We are NPAs,'' referring to the rebel New People's Army,and warned bystanders not to interfere.
Makati, a twin city of Manila with a population of about 440,000,is the country's major banking and financial center and is also thehome of numerous foreign embassies.
Taylo was the 10th soldier or policeman slain in the Manila areain the last two weeks.
The military says communist rebels havekilled up to 65 soldiers and police in the capital region sinceJanuary.
The New People's Army also claimed responsibility for the April21 assassination of U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe, who wasslain on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Groupheadquarters in suburban Quezon City.
Gen. Alexander Aguirre,Capital Region commander, announced formation of a special taskforce to track down rebel assassins in the capital.
``It is really very unfortunate and I do sympathize with thefamily of Col. Taylo,'' said Mrs. Aquino, whose husband Benigno wasslain in a political assassination in 1983.
``And I hope that this,perhaps, could be a reminder to all our people in the military andpolice that they should take necessary precautions to ward off theseassasination attempts.''
``This is war and somebody is bound to get hurt in the process,''Ileto said.
Despite the escalating violence, Mrs. Aquino said she still plansto go ahead with a visit to Western Europe this month.

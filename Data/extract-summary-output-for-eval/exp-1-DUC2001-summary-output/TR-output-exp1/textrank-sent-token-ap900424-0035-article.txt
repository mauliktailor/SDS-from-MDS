Introduction: A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylorbattled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by aventilator, doctors say.
Hospital officials described her condition late Monday asstabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of thepneumonia.
Analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take untilThursday, said her spokeswoman, Chen Sam.
She was in the intensive careunit at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
``She is seriously ill,'' her doctors said in a statement.``After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by aventilator.
Her condition is presently stabilizing and herphysicians are pleased with her progress.''
Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.
While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator,it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G.Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert whoemphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.
Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restoreoxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathingdifficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said.
``It may be that because she is such a prominent person, theyare taking a conservative course,'' he added.
Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,particularly back troubles from filming of ``National Velvet' in1945, when she fell off a horse.
During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylorunderwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help herbreathe.
She appeared at the 1961 Academy Awards with a bandageover her scar as she accepted the ``Butterfield 8'' Oscar.

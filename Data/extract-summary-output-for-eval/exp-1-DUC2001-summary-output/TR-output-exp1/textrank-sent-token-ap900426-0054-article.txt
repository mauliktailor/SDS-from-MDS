Introduction: Elizabeth Taylor has rallied from anear-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out inher ``balcony attire'' to wave to reporters _ but is ``not out ofthe woods,'' doctors say.
``I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and Ibelieve that has now passed,'' Dr. Bernard Weintraub, a lungspecialist treating Miss Taylor at St. Johns Hospital and HealthCenter, said Wednesday.
The 58-year-old actress was taken off the ventilator that hadaided her breathing for several days and was smiling again and``very happy the tube was out,'' said Dr. Patricia Murray, aninfectious disease specialist.
``She said she'd come out and wave to you but she's not in herbalcony attire,'' the doctor said.
Miss Taylor has had back troubles since she fell off a horseduring filming in 1945 of ``National Velvet.''
She had to undergo atracheotomy during a bout with pneumonia in 1961 that nearly killedher.

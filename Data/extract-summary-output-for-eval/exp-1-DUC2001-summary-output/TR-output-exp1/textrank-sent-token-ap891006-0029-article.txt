Introduction:   Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knockedoff track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids,says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.
I lost my gold medal,'' the Canadiantold reporters as legislation to classify anabolic steroids as acontrolled substance was introduced Thursday.
``I'm here to tell the people of this country it's wrong tocheat, not to take it , it's bad for your health.''
Watching Johnson was his chief nemesis: Carl Lewis, the man whowas awarded the Olympic gold medals Johnson lost.
``I think it's great,'' Lewis said of the legislation.
Lewis said he attended the news conference because he wasworking on his autobiography and one of the chapters deals withsteroids.
He said he didn't intend to upstage Johnson.
Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and BenjaminGilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented thelegislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlledsubstance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids bycollege, high school and even junior high school athletes whobelieve the substance will enhance their performance.
Levine referred to the abuse of steroids as ``the silent side ofthe drug disease in this country.''
Johnson later stepped up to the microphones and in a quiet voicewith a slight stutter told other athletes not to make the samemistake he did, urging them ``to come forward, to come clean.''
Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids,indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson ``if he comesback and he's clean.''

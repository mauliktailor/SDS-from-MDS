``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president saidin a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20miles north of here.
Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, saidthat quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he saidsuch requirements should be controlled by state and local welfareofficials, not the federal government.
The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6percent, up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3per cent, which was a 14-year low.
To deal with this, he said, his administration launched aprogram encouraging states to come up with their own plans to getpeople off the welfare rolls.
``Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposedwidespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good oldcommon sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work,'' thepresident said.
``If Congress presents me with a bill thatreplaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity ofself-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans onwelfare, I will use my veto pen.''
Downey said that while more people than ever before are working,``the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better offtoday than he or she was 10 years ago; in fact things have gottenworse.''
The poorest 40 percent of American families, with incomesadjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 yearsago; the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decadeago; and 32.5 million Americans remain mired in poverty, he said.
``Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary,but those requirements should be controlled by state and localofficials who administer our welfare programs, not federalbureaucrats,'' Downey said.

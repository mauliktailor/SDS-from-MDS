Introduction: Cloudy weather Saturday threatened tomar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hopingto glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening,when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weatherwith a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
At that time, the moon will begin graduallymoving between the Earth and the sun.
The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last83 seconds.
After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon willmove away, uncovering more and more of the sun.
In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes aftersunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon.
AtJoensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degreesabove the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers.
The sun rises unusually early during summer in the extremenorthern latitudes where Finland is located.
During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have beenfull of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice forspectators not to stare directly into the sun.
The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide fromthe northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the KolaPeninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands nearAlaska.
Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse,including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun.
Seppo Linnaluoto of the Ursa Astronomical Association said thebest place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeastSoviet Union.
The last total eclipse to be seen in Finland occurred in 1945.

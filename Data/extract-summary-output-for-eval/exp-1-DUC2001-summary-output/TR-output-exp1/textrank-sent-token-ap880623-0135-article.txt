Introduction: Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the questionof counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whetherfollowing the letter of the Constitution results in a system thatis unfair to citizens.
The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which wouldrequire the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in thecountry legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used inreapportioning seats in the House of Representatives.
The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to cound allthe ``persons'' in the country every 10 years for purposes ofreapportionment.
Noting that at times in the past blacks and Indians have beenexcluded from participation in government, he commented: ``I do notwant to return to a time when some human beings are considered lessthan equal in the eyes of the law.''
``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has countedall residents of the states, including both legal and illegalaliens,'' added Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``It was never theintent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionmentpurposes.''
And Rep. Albert G. Bustamente, D-Texas, termed the worry overcounting aliens ``hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement ofAmericans into western and southern states has had a much largereffect on representation than the presence of aliens.
The Census Bureau also opposes the bills, contending that theeffort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay andcomplicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell thetruth anyway.
But Reps. Tom Petri, R-Wis. and William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basicright to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congressto states where the aliens live.
And Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., contended that counting aliens``in effect, is granting representation in Congress to individualswho have entered this country by breaking the laws of the UnitedStates.

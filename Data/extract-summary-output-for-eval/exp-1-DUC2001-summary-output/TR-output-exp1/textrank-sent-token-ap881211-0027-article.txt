Introduction: The chairman of the House Agriculture Committeesays hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Servicehandled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West,including one-third of Yellowstone National Park.
``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area,you speak to two and you get three opinions,'' says Rep. Kika de laGarza, a Texas Democrat.
``I was in Montana and I visited with some people and I have someconcern over some of the practices of the Forest Service,'' de laGarza said in an interview last week.
De la Garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearingsnationwide in preparation for the 1990 Farm Bill and will look atthe U.S. Department of Agriculture's response to this year'sdrought-relief legislation.
De la Garza said he hopes the House Interior Committee, which hasjurisdiction over the National Park Service, and the Agriculturesubcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the U.S. ForestService, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, theworst in a century.
The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300million fighting the summer fires, the Forest Service said.
The mostsevere were in and around Yellowstone and Alaska, although therewere fires in the South, California and the Pacific Northwest.

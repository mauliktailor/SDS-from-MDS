The commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., said thatalthough the increase causes concern, the city Department ofHealth is "acting aggressively to halt the epidemic."
The health department said it is providing tuberculosistesting and treatment for the Human ResourcesAdministration's program for the homeless, and will trainstaff members on tuberculosis prevention and control.
The Board of Health approved a resolution last yearrequiring all children entering city schools to be tested.

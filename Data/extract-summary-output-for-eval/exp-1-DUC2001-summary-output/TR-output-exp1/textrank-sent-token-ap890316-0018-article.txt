But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutchscientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happenedabout 150 years later, on March 5, 1223
The tablet was found in 1948 in the ruins of Ugarit, an ancientcity near Syria's Mediterranean coast.
``Apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the Sun and thesudden appearance of Mars had to be resolved by an explanationthrough liver divination,'' wrote the researchers from theUniversity of Amsterdam and Leiden University.
They concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tabletmisidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred.
In addition, the text apparently indicates that Mars was visibleat the time of the eclipse, the Dutch researchers said.
The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and thestudy assumes that citizens of Ugarit followed an Egyptian-stylecalendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said.
Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed,it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solareclipse, Edwin Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory in LosAngeles, said in a telephone interview.
The next-oldest record was made in China in the Eighth CenturyB.C., said Krupp, a researcher in ancient astronomy.

Introduction:KEY Hispanic groups in the US are making stringent side agreements, aimed atprotecting worker rights and the environment, a condition of their supportfor the North American Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.
Leaders of important Hispanic coalitions such as La Raza, a civil rightsgroup, and the Southwest Voter Registration Project said they fearedHispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact of Nafta.
'The most competitive sectors on both sides of the border would win,' saidProf Raul Hinojosa, of the University of California in Los Angeles and aleader of the Southwest Voter Registration Project. '
However, business organisations like the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce andthe Hispanic Trade Council are enthusiastic backers of the deal.
Mr Abel Guerra of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said he feared sideagreements dealing with issues on the environment and labour rights couldjeopardise Nafta. '
At the other end of the spectrum lies Mr Segundo Mercado-Llorens of theUnited Food and Commercial Workers International Union who is vehementlyopposed to the current incarnation of Nafta. '

Introduction: Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse ofstatistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries.
The statistics I used refer to Latin America, the principal thrust of theargument of the Bishop of Oxford, which focused largely on Brazil.
The limiting case is the international development association loans,50-year loans, unindexed for inflation, at zero interest.
If the funds areused productively, debt service is not a burden in the critical sense thatthe debtors would be better off if they had not borrowed.
I do not know what Mr Skinner has in mind in referring to institutionsserving only western interests, and by clear implication inflict sufferingon the poor.
What I do know is that throughout Asia, Africa and LatinAmerica the level of material achievement declines as we move away from theeffect of western commerce.
To harp on alleged external causes of Third World poverty diverts attentionfrom the real factors behind this poverty which are domestic, and therebyfrom the possibilities of addressing these.
It is pertinent also that the poorest are low among the priorities of thelocal rulers.
State help for the poorest, especially the rural poor,conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and maynot accord with local mores.
An Arab-dominated Sudanese government will nothelp the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armedconflict; the Sinhalese government will not help the Tamil poor, nor willthe government of Ethiopia the poor of Tigre.
Encouraging Third World countries to default inhibits the inflowof productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that wentwith it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries,notably in south-east Asia, west Africa and Latin America.

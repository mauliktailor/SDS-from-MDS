Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction ofYugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the mostpolitically liberal and prosperous of the country's six memberrepublics.
Slovenia ``should be set up as a sovereign state, with allattributes of factual authority and with full international-legalrights,'' Tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the Slovenianpresidency, the top local ruling body.
The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, MilanKucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the newconstitution will be the ``constitution of the sovereign state ofSlovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics),'' Tanjug said.
Slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and themedia in Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, andparticularly in the country's largest republic of Serbia, ofharboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interestsat the expense of federal goals.
More than 70 percent of the residents of the northern republicbelieve their region might be better off if it were outside theYugoslav federation, results of a public opinion poll said lastMarch.
Also Monday, Serbia's president Slobodan Milosevic, in a speechto the Serbian parliament, said the new constitution Serbia ispreparing is designed to ``offset the transformation of federalYugoslavia into a confederation.

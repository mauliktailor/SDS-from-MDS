Introduction:PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within thenext 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes.
He told the National Governors' Association that he was committed to 'endingwelfare as we know it' with measures to finance expanded job training forthe unemployed, matched by a requirement that people must do some kind ofwork for their welfare cheque.
The president said he would focus on better implementation of the FamilySupport Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-forcewhich he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the newadministration's intentions, fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasison requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fallprey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding ofexisting programmes.
With the onset of the recession, state revenues have been constrained whilethe number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent.
As a result, fewstates have been able to implement in full the act's requirement thatwelfare recipients take part in some form of education or training.

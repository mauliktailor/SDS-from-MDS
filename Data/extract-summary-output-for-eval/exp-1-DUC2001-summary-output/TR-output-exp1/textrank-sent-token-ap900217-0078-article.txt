At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followedby a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientistssaid.
``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducingremission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber CancerInstitute in Boston.
``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of peoplewho would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annualmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
A number of treatments for AIDSand AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many ofthem are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
But that has changed.``There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,''Mullins said.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that anepidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the innercities.
Andunlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casualcontact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air.
Many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individualswho were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract AIDS.
Theylose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria,which normally would have remained dormant, and tuberculosisappears.
There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis isspreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS,but that is likely, Vermund said.
He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic,probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the1970s.

There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead ormissing in a town in Colombia the day before.
In Colombia, an official of the state of Bolivar in the northernpart of the country said the storm triggered flooding in the townof Carmen de Bolivar, about 360 miles north of the capital ofBogota.
Water roared down three gullies in the town as the storm passedMonday, Victor Leon Mendoza, a state government administrator, toldthe Colombian radio chain RCN.
``Preliminary reports from the mayor's office indicate thatabout 50 persons are dead or missing'' in the town, he said.
At noon EDT today, Joan's center was near latitude 11.1 northand longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the Colombian coastand about 380 miles east of the island of San Andres off the coastof Nicaragua.
It reached hurricane force Monday night and its center began tobecome better defined, a sign the system could intensify over openwater into the western Caribbean, forecasters said.
On its present path, it would be at least 48 hours before themain part of the hurricane reached Central America, Gross said lateMonday.
Also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the farsouthern Caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deep-oceanwater to the surface, said Gross.
Joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricaneseason when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct. 11.
Gilbert, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, leftmore than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage asit tore through Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico's Yucatanpeninsula last month.

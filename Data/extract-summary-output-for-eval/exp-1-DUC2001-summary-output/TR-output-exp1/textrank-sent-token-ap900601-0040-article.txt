Introduction: The 1990 Atlantic hurricane seasonbegins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East andGulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a newera of destructive storms.
The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by atropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavyrain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into ahurricane.
Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, areill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center.
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportpredicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine toTexas will grow 60 percent, counting from 1960 until 2010.
Somestates such as Florida and Texas will experience near 200 percentgrowth during the period, the report said.
``What we're looking at is the possibility of greater destructionand greater loss of life,'' Sheets said Thursday.
The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo last yeartaught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate andprotect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from Maine toTexas, Sheets said.
``If the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come,we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes,'' said Sheets.
Hugo killed 28 people in the easternCaribbean and 29 more in South Carolina and caused a record $10billion in damage.
Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity arebased on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves andincreased rainfall trends in West Africa, near the breeding watersfor most hurricanes.
Also, he said Hugo showed inadequacies in the Emergency BroadcastSystem and some communities used emergency shelters ill-suited towithstand a powerful hurricane.

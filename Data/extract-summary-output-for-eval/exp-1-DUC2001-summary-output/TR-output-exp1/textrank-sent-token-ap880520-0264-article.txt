The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followedreports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina thatthere had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
The ministry statement said the federal military council met onMarch 25 and concluded that ``dissident tendencies'' in Sloveniawere part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country'sCommunist government.
The statement did not identify the foreign elements and saidSlovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such aconspiracy.
It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion ata later meeting between the republic's police authorities andLjubljana's military command.
The police said ``they had no available data which would justifysuch evaluations,'' according to the ministry statement.
Itreported the police also said there were no ``subversive forcesbehind'' articles carried in the Slovenian news media.
Mladina, the official publication of the Socialist Youthorganization, wrote of possible military intervention in itscurrent issue.
It published a letter to Slovenia's Communist Party leader MilanKucan from two student unions that said military action had beenplanned earlier this year, including the arrests of ``nonconformistjournalists, writers and officials.''

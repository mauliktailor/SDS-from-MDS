Introduction:MR HARRY Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the Anglo AmericanCorporation of South Africa and De Beers, is to visit Russia next week at atime when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamondindustry.
It appears to beanother sign that the former De Beers' chairman is taking a more active rolein guiding the company through its current difficulties,' says theDiamantaire newsletter today.
De Beers said yesterday that the visit by Mr Oppenheimer, accompanied by hisson Nicholas, was a private one originally arranged for August last year butpostponed because of the coup d'etat in the former Soviet Union.
However, it admitted that Mr Oppenheimer would be meeting senior officialsfrom the Russian diamond industry during his stay because he would be goingto some of the big mines in Siberia and would be present when De Beers heldthe formal opening of its Moscow office on September 8.De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a Dollars5bn, five-year sales contract with the former Soviet Union and at the sametime advanced a loan of Dollars 1bn.
After the break-up of the Soviet Union the contract was continued withRosalmazzoloto, the Russian gold and diamond organisation, and an exclusivesales agreement was later signed with Yukutia, the area in eastern Siberiawhere most Russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomousrepublic in the Russian Federation.
'Diamantaire points out that the Russian parliament is to consider next montha plan to set up a state diamond centre under the control of the financeministry and Komdragmet, formerly know as Gokhran, the Moscow depository ofdiamonds.
Reports suggest that the diamond centre would have exclusive rights to buyall rough diamonds mined in the Russian Federation and it would also have amonopoly of sorting gem diamonds.
Observers expect Mr Oppenheimer to bring his formidable negotiating skillsto bear to ensure that De Beers grip on the diamond market is in no wayweakened by any changes in Russia.
Meanwhile, the newsletter, which is available only to subscribers to DiamondInternational magazine, also says that reports in Antwerp suggest that twoof the Belgian diamond trading organisations with which the CSO has aspecial relationship have been punished by temporarily being excluded fromthe CSO's 'sights' or diamond sales.

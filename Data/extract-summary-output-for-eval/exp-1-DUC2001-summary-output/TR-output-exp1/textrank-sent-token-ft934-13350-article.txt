Introduction:THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North AmericanDevelopment Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job lossesresulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The so-called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman EstebanTorres, who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to supportadjustment throughout the continent.
It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants areason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it ispushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around.
The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towardsit.
Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few daysbefore the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to getthe remaining 8 votes.
State bystate, undecided congressmen are being lured to the White House for intimatebriefings, as are business leaders and journalists.
Members of the cabinet are being sent to congressional districts, where theyvisit and publicise factories that are expected to gain jobs if Naftapasses.
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday gave his second impassioned speech onNafta at an exhibit on the White House lawn of products likely to benefitfrom Nafta.

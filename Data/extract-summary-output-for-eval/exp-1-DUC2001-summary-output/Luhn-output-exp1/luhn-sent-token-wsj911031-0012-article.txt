In its 1972 decision Bullock v. Carter and again in its1982 decision Clements v. Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Courtdetermined that a particular candidate has no "fundamental"right to ballot access or to run for office.
Should the court rule against term limits by the states,numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely bepassed that have many of the same effects as term limits.

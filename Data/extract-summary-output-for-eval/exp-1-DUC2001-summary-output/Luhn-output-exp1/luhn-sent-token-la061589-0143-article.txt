Introduction: Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it should be awarded to Carl Lewis, many U.S. track and field officials and athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid use.
"I would have to see the evidence, but if he was on drugs at the time of the World Championships, my thought would be to remove his record," said Ollan Cassell, executive director of The Athletics Congress, the national governing board for the sport.

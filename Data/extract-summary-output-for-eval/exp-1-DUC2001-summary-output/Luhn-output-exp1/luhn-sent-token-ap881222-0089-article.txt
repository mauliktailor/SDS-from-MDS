David Kyd, chief public relations officer, said ``it would seemto us that the most likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard,'' andthat structural problems were unlikely to have been involved in thecrash because of the sudden loss of contact with the plane.
An anonymous caller to the AP office in London claimedresponsibility for the crash and said it was in retaliation for thedowning of an Iran Air Airbus by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes inJuly.

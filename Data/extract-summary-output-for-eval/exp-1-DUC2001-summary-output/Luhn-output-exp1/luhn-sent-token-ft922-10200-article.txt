Shortly after his appointment in 1978, Mr Gates told a Hispanic audiencethat Hispanic officers were not promoted because they were lazy, and helater suggested that the carotid choke hold - a police technique severelycurbed in 1983 after police had killed 16 suspects with it - might be moredangerous for blacks because their arteries did not open up as fast as on'normal people'.In March, Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led aninvestigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angelespolice officer, although a judge had just released the two men wrongfullyconvicted, calling police conduct 'reprehensible' and urging an immediateinvestigation of the 'sordid record'.The detective involved now heads the unit which investigates shootingsinvolving police officers.
President George Bush last year called Mr Gates 'an exemplary police chief,'although at the time he called the conduct of the four Los Angeles officers -whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggeredthis week's protests and violence - 'sickening' and 'outrageous'.A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under thechairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretaryof state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, interms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates theofficer from the community'.Besides recommending that Mr Gates should go, the Christopher commissionurged a policy of community policing with more foot patrols, as well asmeasures to discipline racist police officers and to improve theinvestigation of complaints about police brutality.

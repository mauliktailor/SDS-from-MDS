Nationwide opinionpolls about this, the biggest civil-engineering project inEurope this century, show convincingly that the English don'twant a fixed link; that they like ferries and their islandstory; that they are worried about the costs to theenvironment and to themselves; that they are afraid of long,dark tunnels underwater; and of rabies, rats and terroristscrawling through, not to mention other undesirables, say,Europeans in general.
We only hear of other machines, such as a giant pump ina 230-foot shaft that sucks the spoil slurry out of thetunnel, but we get some more big figures for the notebooks: Two thousand tons of spoil come out every hour; 500 tons ofmaterial go in; money, the press here reports, is being spentat a rate of $4.4 million a day.

Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory overstubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idahoand Alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in theUS.The Brady bill's opponents in Congress say it will inconvenience onlylaw-abiding citizens, not criminals who buy or steal their weapons away fromthe government's prying eyes.
But even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that itwill make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year ofnew or used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation;and will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidentaldeaths involving guns each year.

However, the chic hotspot for eclipse watchers won't be Mexico, but the big island of Hawaii, wherethe 18,000 tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will bejoined by an additional 30,000 or more coming to watch the sun go out for fourminutes.
But Mexico will host the biggest share of travelers, partly because of itseasy access from the United States and partly since the eclipse will lastlongest here: up to seven minutes, which is three more minutes than themaximum length in Hawaii.

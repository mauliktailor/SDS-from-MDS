Virginia's version, latercopied by New York and North Carolina, brought together threeelements in one article -- affirmation of a right to beararms, reliance on state militia, and opposition to a standingarmy:"That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; thata well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the peopletrained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense ofa free state; that standing armies, in times of peace, aredangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided.
This militia amendment was referred to a congressionalcommittee, and came out of committee in this form:"A well regulated militia, composed of the body of thepeople, being the best security of a free state, the right ofthe people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; butno person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to beararms.

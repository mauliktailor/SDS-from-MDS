State-owned British Rail will not commit itself to building ahigh-speed link from London to the tunnel in time to make thethree-hour journey a reality in 1993.
Eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatenedTrans-Manche Link, the consortium of 10 British and Frenchengineering companies building the tunnel, with penalties of $25million if the diggers did not pass the three-mile mark by Nov. 1.

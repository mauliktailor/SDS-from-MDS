In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.
Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths inrecent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which aremost common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year.

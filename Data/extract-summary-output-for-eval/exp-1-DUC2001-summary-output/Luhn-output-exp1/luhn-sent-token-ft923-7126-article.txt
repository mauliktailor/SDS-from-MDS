The onset of the dry seasonand the fall in river levels from the end of May this year has encouragedwhat De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamondbusiness, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supplyof illicit Angolan diamonds reaching the market'.Even though there are so many diggers at work, questions are being askedabout whether there might be more to this 'explosion.'
But the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risensteadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recessionthe price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retailmarket from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 10,000.The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central SellingOrganisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.

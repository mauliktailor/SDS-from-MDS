Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the averageincrease in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across theOECD between 1989 and 1992.In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state couldbecome insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.
For the OECD as a whole,the age dependency ratio is predicted to rise from about 19 per cent in 1990to 28 per cent by 2020 and 37 per cent by 2040.Some countries face much greater pressures from the ageing of theirpopulations than others.

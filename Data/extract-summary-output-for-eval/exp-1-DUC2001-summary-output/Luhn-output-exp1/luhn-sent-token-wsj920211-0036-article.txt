I said thatalthough the Second Amendment has nothing to do with privateuses of arms , there is an unenumerated but undeniable rightto own a gun.
Another letter writer thinks I have confused the issue bycalling the duty to serve in the militia a right to serve,but if he will look at the debates in the First Congress hewill see that there is no confusion at all, that the authorsof the Second Amendment were talking about the right toserve.

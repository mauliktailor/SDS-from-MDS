Interviewed in his Phoenix office as the firestorm was building, a serene DeConcini accused the NRA of "lies and exaggerations" about his bill; he strongly disputed the NRA's claim that a provision banning any gun "nearly identical" to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover virtually all semiautomatics.
For the assault-weapons fight, the NRA has sent dozens of police officers to Washington to offset pro-ban lobbying by police chiefs, launched a national newspaper and TV ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a 900 toll phone number that has already produced thousands of NRA form letters to President Bush and members of Congress.

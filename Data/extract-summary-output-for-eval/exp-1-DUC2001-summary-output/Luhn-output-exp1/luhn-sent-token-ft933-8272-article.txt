New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week andlast month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a braindisorder similar to BSE.Richard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leadingcritic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmerswhose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down tochance.
'The advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer Kenneth Calmanand chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, put out a detailed statement tojustify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old Duncan Templeman -following that of Peter Warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features thatgive cause for undue concern'.The official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, eventhough it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract adisease as rare as CJD.

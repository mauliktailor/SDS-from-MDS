Introduction:   A coalition of members of Congress announcedWednesday that they plan to sue the Census Bureau in an effort toforce the agency to delete illegal aliens from its count in 1990.
Some 40 members of the House joined the Federation for AmericanImmigration Reform in announcing that the suit would be filedThursday in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, spokesmen said at anews conference here.
The group contends that including the estimated 2 million ormore illegal aliens in the national head count, which is used todistribute seats in the House of Representatives, will cause unfairshifts of seats from one state to another.
Nonetheless, Dan Stein of the immigration reform federationcontended that illegal aliens should not be allowed to be part ofdetermining the political structure of the United States.
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said the Census Bureau should actuallycount everyone but that it should develop a method to determine howmany people are illegally in the country, and them deduct thatnumber from the figures used for reapportioning Congress.

Introduction:   If the two sides trying to force changes inthe 1990 census both get their way
, the results would nearlybalance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.
Meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to beincreased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census_ most often blacks and Hispanics living in urban areas.
``If both sides get their way, the only change would be aflip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said WilliamO'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent PopulationReference Bureau.
O'Hare told a breakfast briefing for Northeast and Midwestmembers of Congress that he estimates their region will lose 14House seats following the 1990 census.
Using estimates of the number of illegal aliens and undercountedminorities, he said that deleting the one group and adding in theother would make little difference in the long run.
The only change, he said, would be that California would gainfive new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two ratherthan just one.
``That's easy to understand, since there are so manyundocumented aliens in California,'' he commented.
O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to bethe big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with again of four and Texas adding three.

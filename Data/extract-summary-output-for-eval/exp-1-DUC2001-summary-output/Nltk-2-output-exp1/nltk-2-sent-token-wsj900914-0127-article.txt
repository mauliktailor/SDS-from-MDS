Introduction:Hurricane activity off the U.S. East Coast will intensify,warned a weather researcher who reported a new method forpredicting Atlantic tropical storms.
William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science atColorado State University and a hurricane forecastingspecialist, said he uncovered a strong association betweenseasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intensehurricanes.
Based on the new findings, Mr. Gray predicted earlier thissummer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be aboveaverage, and so far he seems to be right.
In July he saidthere would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of whichsix would be hurricanes.
The National Hurricane Center saidthat as of yesterday there have been nine named storms thisyear, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.
Mr. Gray said hebelieves that in the absence of moisture, these stormsquickly dissipate, but that the storms gather strength withadditional moisture.
Mr.
Gray said his research, published in the current issueof Science, suggests that "intense Caribbean hurricanesGilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be theforerunners of this change.
"Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel withthe number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr. Grayfound a striking correlation.
From 1947 to 1969, forinstance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especiallyabundant, and during this time there were 13 severehurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
From 1970 to1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, andhurricane activity was unusually low; only one severehurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area.
Mr.
Gray searched back in recent history and found thatthe Sahel, which includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Maliand Gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry andwet weather.
Mr.
Gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, theSahel is entering a wet period.

Introduction:L. Gordon Crovitz quotes Alexander Hamilton in "LawmakersSue for Their Jobs -- Another Reason for Term Limits" (Ruleof Law, June 19) to note that legislators sometimes takethemselves too seriously.
But is it true, as Mr. Crovitzimplies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms?Clearly not.
In fact, such limits keptMadison out of legislative service at a critical time in thenation's history.
For that reason and others, the Constitutional Conventionunanimously rejected term limits and the First Congresssoundly defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals.
Hamilton, who did not even support term limitations on thepresidency, reasoned that imposing limits "would be adiminution of the inducements to good behavior."
Madison saidthat some members of Congress will "by frequent re-elections,become members of long-standing; will be thoroughly mastersof the public business.
Over the years, termlimits would have unseated Daniel Webster and Henry Clay 10years before they forged the 1850 Compromise that held theUnion together.
Term limits would have cost us EverettDirksen, who rallied Republicans around early civil-rightsbills and Florida's own Claude Pepper, who long defendedSocial Security and Medicare against revenue raids.
It was not the Federalists but their adversaries whoclamored for term limits, perhaps because they were then outof power.

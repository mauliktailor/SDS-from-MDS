Introduction:
The German government yesterday announced the launch of a new researchproject to examine whether the cattle disease bovine spongiformencephalopathy (BSE) can be transmitted to human beings.
The initiative comes as the country is pushing for a European Union ban onBritish beef imports, arguing that there is still no conclusive evidencethat the disease cannot affect humans.
Seven German universities and research institutes will be sponsored by thecountry's research and technology ministry to examine possible connectionsbetween the origins of BSE and two other diseases,
Creutzfeldt Jakob diseaseand Gerstmann Straussler syndrome, which very rarely affect humans.
Several German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly knownas 'mad cow disease' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle -may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicinesmade with ingredients from contaminated animals.
'The danger that BSE can be transmitted to humans is minimal ornon-existent,' said Professor Hans Kretzschmar from Gottingen University.
'Contaminated British beef will be discussed at a meeting of EU healthministers on March 30, but a German official said that any decisions about aban would be made by the union's agriculture ministers, who were likely toargue that existing safeguards were sufficient.
In 1992, the last year for which figures are available, Germany imported2,092 tonnes of British beef - 2 per cent of all its beef imports from otherEU countries - and 13 tonnes of veal.
A further 50 cases of the disease hadbeen recorded in Switzerland and there were two known cases in Germany, oneof which affected a cow imported from Britain.

Introduction:US INSURERS expect to pay out an estimated Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) inFlorida as a result of Hurricane Andrew - by far the costliest disaster theindustry has ever faced.
The figure is the first official tally of the damage resulting from thehurricane, which ripped through southern Florida last week.
He pledged the government would see through the clean-up'until the job is done'.Although there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level ofinsurance claims, yesterday's figure comes from the Property Claims Servicesdivision of the American Insurance Services Group, the property-casualtyinsurers' trade association.
Mr Gary Kerney, director of catastrophe services at the PCS, said theindustry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone.
It is reckonedthe bulk of the damage - over Dollars 6bn in insured claims - is in DadeCounty, a rural region to the south of Miami.
Yesterday's estimate does not include any projection for claims inLouisiana, which was also affected by the storm, although less severely thanFlorida.
But on the Florida losses alone, Hurricane Andrew becomes the most costlyinsured catastrophe in the US.
By contrast, insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlierthis year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled justDollars 775m.
The LA riots and a series oftornadoes, wind and hailstorms in states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Iowahad already produced insured losses of Dollars 3.9bn.
With Florida'sHurricane
Andrew losses added in, the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn.
This easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in1989, when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prietaearthquake in California.
Wall Street, however, has reacted calmly to the record losses expected, andinsurers' shares - although lower initially - have been firming recently.

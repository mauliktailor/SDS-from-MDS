Introduction:THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's effortsto fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issuedtoday by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president.
The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to makepoverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s.
The shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to makecomprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the thirdworld, allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty.
In the directive, Mr Preston says poverty reduction is 'the benchmark bywhich our performance as a development institution will be measured'.
Headds that the new instructions to staff are intended to 'ensure that thesepolicies are fully reflected in the bank's operations'.The bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past bestpractice on poverty reduction.
These would form the basis for a 'collaborativeapproach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'.The directive signals an attempt to impose a form of 'social conditionality'on borrowing countries. '
Mr Preston's emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developingcountries.
The new directive says structural adjustment lending in the pastdecade 'overshadowed the bank's poverty reduction objectives'.The bank is also reacting to new evidence suggesting that the number of poorin developing countries will rise during the 1990s, rather than stabilise ashad been expected.

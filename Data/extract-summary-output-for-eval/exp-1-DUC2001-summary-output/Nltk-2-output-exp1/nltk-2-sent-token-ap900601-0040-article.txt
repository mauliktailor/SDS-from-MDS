Introduction:
The 1990 Atlantic hurricane seasonbegins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East andGulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a newera of destructive storms.
Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, areill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center.
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportpredicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine toTexas will grow 60 percent, counting from 1960 until 2010.
``What we're looking at is the possibility of greater destructionand greater loss of life,'' Sheets said Thursday.
The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo last yeartaught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate andprotect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from Maine toTexas, Sheets said.
``If the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come,we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes,'' said Sheets.
Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity arebased on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves andincreased rainfall trends in West Africa, near the breeding watersfor most hurricanes.
Between 1940 and 1969, the United States was hit by 22 hurricaneswith minimum winds of 110 mph.
There are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from Category 1,which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to Category 5,with top winds greater then 155 mph.
Both Gilbert and Hugo reached category 5, according tometeorologist Barry Fatchwell of the National Hurricane Center.
Sheets praised most South Carolina officials' response to Hugo,but said some leaders ``didn't have their proverbial act together''and lives may have been saved.
Also, he said Hugo showed inadequacies in the Emergency BroadcastSystem and some communities used emergency shelters ill-suited towithstand a powerful hurricane.

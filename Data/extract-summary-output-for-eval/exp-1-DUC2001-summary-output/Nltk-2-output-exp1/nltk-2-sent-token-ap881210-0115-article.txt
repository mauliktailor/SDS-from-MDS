Introduction:
A top West German military officialsaid Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S. Air Force jet thatkilled six people will further erode popular support for nationaldefense programs.
In the city of Remscheid, fire brigade leader Berthold Hoehlersaid the body of a construction worker was pulled from the rubble ofa house destroyed in the accident, raisng the death toll from theaccident to six.
Later Saturday, at least 4,000 people took part in a torchlightvigil and procession in downtown Remscheid to remember the victimsand to demand an end to low-level flight training missions.
A U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet tore a swath ofdestruction through a working-class neighborhood in the central WestGerman city of Remscheid.
Rescue workers continued to comb thedebris Saturday, as work crews tore down the remains of demolishedhouses.
In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, the inspectorgeneral of West Germany's military said the crash was certain tohave a serious impact on already sinking public support for defenseissues.
``I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hardfacts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace,''which hinge on West Germany's and NATO's security preparedness, hesaid.
West Germany, a staunch NATO ally, borders East Germany andCzechoslovakia, thus putting it on the front lines of the East-Weststruggle.
The U.S. Air Force said in a statement Saturday that the pilot ofthe A-10 ``inadvertently flew into clouds'' while attempting to joinin close formation with another aircraft.
The Air Force statement, quoting Maj.
Gen. Marcus A. Anderson,said the pilot ``then initiated a separation maneuver as is normalif two aircraft in formation lose visual contact.''
The statement said the lead aircraft climbed above the clouds,but that the second A-10 ``continued in a descent.''
Witnesses on the ground, however, have said they saw one of thejet's two engines on fire before it crashed.

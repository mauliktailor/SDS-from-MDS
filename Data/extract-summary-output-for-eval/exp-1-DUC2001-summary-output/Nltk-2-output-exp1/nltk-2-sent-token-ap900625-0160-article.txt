Introduction:
The republic of Slovenia plans tobegin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereigntywithin a new Yugoslav confederation, the state Tanjug news agencyreported Monday.
Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction ofYugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the mostpolitically liberal and prosperous of the country's six memberrepublics.
Slovenia ``should be set up as a sovereign state, with allattributes of factual authority and with full international-legalrights,'' Tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the Slovenianpresidency, the top local ruling body.
The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, MilanKucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the newconstitution will be the ``constitution of the sovereign state ofSlovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics),'' Tanjug said.
Slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and themedia in Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, andparticularly in the country's largest republic of Serbia, ofharboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interestsat the expense of federal goals.
Slovenian authorities claim Serbia is trying to politically andeconomically dominate the Yugoslav federation by introducinggreater federal control and by limiting the autonomy of therepublics.
More than 70 percent of the residents of the northern republicbelieve their region might be better off if it were outside theYugoslav federation, results of a public opinion poll said lastMarch.
Both Slovenia and Croatia, the two Yugoslav republics that heldfree elections this year, have proclaimed a readiness to turn theYugoslav federation of six republics and two provinces into alooser confederation of states cooperating voluntarily.
Also Monday, Serbia's president Slobodan Milosevic, in a speechto the Serbian parliament, said the new constitution Serbia ispreparing is designed to ``offset the transformation of federalYugoslavia into a confederation.

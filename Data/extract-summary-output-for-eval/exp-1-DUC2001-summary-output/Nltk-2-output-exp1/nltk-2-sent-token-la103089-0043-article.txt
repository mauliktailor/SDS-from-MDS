Introduction:
Mother Nature conspired against this struggling marathon Sunday, serving up balmy, windy weather and wilting both the men's and women's fields.
Temperatures during the Old Style/Chicago marathon hovered in the mid-60s, with 53% humidity.
The heat sapped the strength of most runners, giving the patient and steady runners a distinct advantage.
Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever.
Among the women, Lisa Weidenbach of Issaquah, Wash., repeated as champion, with a personal best of 2:28:15, impressive under the circumstances.
It was the second-hottest race in Chicago history, only 1978 was worse.
By comparison, last year's race was 30 degrees cooler at the start.
Most distance runners prefer temperatures in the 40s, with cloud cover.
The race conditions were simply more bad luck for the 12th running of Chicago's marathon, which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor in 1986 and staging no race in 1987.
After a week of summer-like weather, race organizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race; to have, if not impressive times on this flat and fast course, at least a memorable race.
That developed, at points, Sunday, as about 8,000 runners started at Daley Plaza downtown and wended their way through city streets.
The lead pack went through the half-marathon at 1:04:50, a pace that would wither in the second half.
No one who was in the lead pack at the halfway point, with the exception of Montero, finished in the top five.
Davies-Hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race favorite Steve Binns, who lives 30 miles from Davies-Hale in England's West Midlands.
"I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.
At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun.
Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37.
Ed Eyestone was the first U.S. finisher in fourth, 2:14:57.
In the women's race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping.
O'Brien, a 22-year-old from Boston, has been on the verge of a breakthrough for a long time.
Then, the heat from the sun and the perceptible heat of Weidenbach constantly gaining did her in.
They shared some water, then Weidenbach tossed aside the water bottle and put on a surge that left O'Brien flat.
It was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had taken the lead in last year's race.
Carla Beurskens of the Netherlands, at 37 still an amazing runner, eventually passed the struggling O'Brien and placed second 2:30:24.
Given the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach's time might have been as much as two minutes faster.
Davies-Hale, a former plumber from Rugeley, Straffordshire, seemed bemused by the attention and nonplussed that he had just won $50,000 in prize money.
About as far as he seemed willing to go, on the celebrity scale, was to say he had pitched the plumbing job.

Davies-Hale, 27, came to the United States in 1985 and settled in Boulder, Colo., the nation's unofficial running center.
He was a 1984 Olympian in the steeplechase and, on the advice of others, moved up to 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
Still, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is.

Marathon Notes Race organizers insist that this race is at a world-class level, especially pointing to the world's richest purse.
Race director Tim Murphy said the race was not selected by The Athletics Congress, which governs the sport, to conduct testing.

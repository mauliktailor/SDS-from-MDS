Introduction:   Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knockedoff track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids,says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.
I lost my gold medal,'' the Canadiantold reporters as legislation to classify anabolic steroids as acontrolled substance was introduced Thursday.
``I'm here to tell the people of this country it's wrong tocheat, not to take it
, it's bad for your health.''
``I think it's great,''
Lewis said of the legislation.
However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: ``Idon't understand why Ben Johnson's here.''
Lewis said he attended the news conference because he wasworking on his autobiography and one of the chapters deals withsteroids.
Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and BenjaminGilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented thelegislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlledsubstance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids bycollege, high school and even junior high school athletes whobelieve the substance will enhance their performance.
``But if we act quickly enough torestrict steroid distribution, and to increase the penalties forillicit distribution, we can prevent this plague from spreading.''
Johnson later stepped up to the microphones and in a quiet voicewith a slight stutter told other athletes not to make the samemistake he did, urging them ``to come forward, to come clean.''
Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids,indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson ``if he comesback and he's clean.''

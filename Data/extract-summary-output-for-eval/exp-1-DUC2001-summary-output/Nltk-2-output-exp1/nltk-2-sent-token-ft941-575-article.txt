Introduction:
The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a banon British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE).The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legalaction if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officialssaid yesterday.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover foraction against the UK.Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UKafter the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK.
The commissionhas reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and thatthere is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE andCreutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
British officials say that the EU single market will be disrupted unless allmember states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat ofunilateral action risks a collapse in beef consumption similar to the fallthat followed the 1990 BSE scare.

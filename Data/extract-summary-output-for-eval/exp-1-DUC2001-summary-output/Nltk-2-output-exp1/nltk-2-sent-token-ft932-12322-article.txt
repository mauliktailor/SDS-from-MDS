Introduction:MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen thebank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. '
However, he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration forthe bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending thatshould have an explicit poverty focus.
In congressional testimony this week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasurysecretary, said the US wanted to see more funding that 'will create socialand economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strifeand economic mismanagement. '
'In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed toinclude specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from MrPreston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief.
The share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' isstill only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from Mr Preston for anincreased emphasis on investment in people.
At a news conference Mr Preston said the bank was making progress: a decadeago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development andonly 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus onpoverty.
While he expected anincrease in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declinedto set precise targets for bank staff.
Mr Preston, however, does intend to take several new steps to sharpen thebank's focus on poverty.
We want this to become thenorm for our operations in the years to come,' Mr Preston said.
He also released a report, 'Implementing the World Bank's Strategy to ReducePoverty - Progress and Challenges,' that outlines progress to date.
He said hoped for a clear signal from this week's meeting of the Group ofSeven leading industrial countries that they would deliver on commitmentsfor a Dollars 18bn replenishment of resources for the InternationalDevelopment Agency (IDA), the centrepiece of bank efforts to reduce poverty.

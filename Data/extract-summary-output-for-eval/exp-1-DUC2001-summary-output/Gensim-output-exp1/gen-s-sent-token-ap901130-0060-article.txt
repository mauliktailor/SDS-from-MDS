The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season had more stormsthan usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of morefrequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years.
But this year's batch did not include the devastating storms ofyears past and at least one forecaster thinks 1991 will be a calmeryear.
Dr. William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at ColoradoState University, thinks a dry spell in West Africa during the pasttwo decades explained the reduction of storms along the easternseaboard in the last 20 years.
Some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end ofa 20-year drought - and may have spawned Gilbert in 1988 and Hugoin 1989.
Gray on Thursday predicted a below-average hurricane season in1991.
He based his forecast on several factors, including ananticipated below-average rainfall in the Sahel.
But Gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlookfor the 1990s and the early years of the next century is for moreintense hurricanes than those of the last two decades.
,'' hesaid, recalling Hurricane Gilbert that wracked the Caribbean andHurricane Hugo that devastated South Carolina - two of the mostdestructive Atlantic hurricanes ever.
In this year's season, there were 14 named storms, eight of themhurricanes.
A weather disturbance becomes a tropical storm, and is given aname, if its sustained winds reach 39 mph.

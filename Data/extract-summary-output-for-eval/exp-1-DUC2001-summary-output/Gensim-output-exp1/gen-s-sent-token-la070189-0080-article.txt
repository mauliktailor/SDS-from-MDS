Introduction:Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on an 8,200-acre brush fire in Cleveland National Forest that destroyed 11 structures near Lake Elsinore in Riverside County.
Aided by higher humidity and a decrease in wind, fire crews had more than 85% of the blaze surrounded late Friday afternoon and began releasing many of the 2,300 people who had been fighting the fire.
2,000 Acres Burned Meanwhile, a brush fire that burned more than 2,000 acres of mostly rugged terrain in the Antelope Valley this week was contained by firefighters Friday morning, authorities said.
Authorities estimated that fighting the fire near Lake Elsinore will wind up costing $1.5 million.
Charred Landscape Dean McAlister, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman, said fire crews late Friday were hiking into the rugged, charred landscape along the Orange-Riverside county line to do battle with sections of the fire still consuming brush and timber.
Although officials first believed that the fire would be contained by late Friday afternoon, they revised their estimates because of troubles battling lingering flames on the southern edge of the blaze, inside the rugged, 3,400-acre San Mateo Wilderness.
Residents Return Residents evacuated from 200 homes near Lake Elsinore on Wednesday evening have returned to their houses, authorities said.
Four firefighters were injured fighting the blaze, one of them seriously, authorities said.
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Robert Brady said the Antelope Valley fire was 100% contained at 8 a.m. Friday.
All Los Angeles County firefighters were released from the fire lines, and a crew of 95 Forest Service firefighters were left to "mop up," Brady said.
Six structures were burned, including one home, and more than 1,000 people were forced to temporarily evacuate on Wednesday.

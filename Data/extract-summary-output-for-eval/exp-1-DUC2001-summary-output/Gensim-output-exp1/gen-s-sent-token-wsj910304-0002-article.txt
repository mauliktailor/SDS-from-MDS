The incidence of active tuberculosis cases inthe city rose 38% in 1990, to 3,520 cases, according to thehealth commissioner.
Myers Jr., said thatalthough the increase causes concern, the city Department ofHealth is "acting aggressively to halt the epidemic."
Thehealth department has a high cure rate in its tuberculosisclinics, with more than 70% successfully completing therapy.
Dr. Myers said that besides special prevention andintervention strategies for high-risk populations, the cityis providing $1.3 million for additional efforts.
The health department said it is providing tuberculosistesting and treatment for the Human ResourcesAdministration's program for the homeless, and will trainstaff members on tuberculosis prevention and control.
The Health Department estimates that one million NewYorkers may be infected by the TB germ.
But only a fractionof a percent of those who have active tuberculosis diseasecan spread the infection to susceptible individuals.

Government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advisedor ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.
The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causingbillions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterdaywas moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140miles an hour.
Ms Kate Hale, director of emergency services in Florida's Dade County, whichbore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already causedDollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 10bn) of damage.
The US industry's Property Claims Service, theofficial compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tallyof the Florida bill.
A hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along 470 miles of Gulf coastfrom Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas.
New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable becausethe city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through itscentre and a large lake immediately to the north.
In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some10-15 miles south of Miami.
The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the USindustry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State FarmGroup and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck.
A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company hadroughly 20 per cent of the Florida market.
According to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claims adjustment firm, otherinsurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are HartfordInsurance, Aetna and Travellers.

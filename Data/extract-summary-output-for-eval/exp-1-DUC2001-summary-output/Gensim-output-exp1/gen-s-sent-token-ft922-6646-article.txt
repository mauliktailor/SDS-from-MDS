Introduction:THE war in the former republics of Yugoslavia is forcing Slovene enterprisesto find alternative trading partners among European Community countries as ameans of compensating for lost markets in the region.
Until 1990, over 30 per cent of Slovenia's exports were with the formerYugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between Comecon, the nowdefunct socialist trading block, and western European countries.
The loss of markets in the former Yugoslavia, and the war, has led to asharp drop in industrial production, which last year fell by 15 per cent,and will fall a further 12 per cent this year.
Mr Feri Horvath, head of Slovenia's Chamber of Commerce, said Slovenia,which declared its independence last June, must seek new markets because therepublic is too small to be able to attract large amounts of foreigninvestment to foster growth.
Renault, French car manufacturer, which assembles cars in Slovenia, andSiemens, German-based mechanical and electrical goods maker, which has ajoint venture with Iskra, Slovenia's electronic and telecommunicationsmanufacturer, have used Slovenia as a base for exporting to other parts ofYugoslavia, as well as to western Europe.'We have recently signed bilateral trade agreements with Croatia andMacedonia,' said Mr Horvath.
In the meantime, Slovene enterprises, particularly those in the furniture,electronics, paper, and white goods sector, are exporting to EuropeanCommunity countries.
Last year, total exports of goods reachedDollars 3.9bn, and imports, Dollars 4.1bn.'Our enterprises are beginning to find new markets,' said Mr Horvath, addingthat Germany, Italy, France and Austria are now Slovenia's main tradingpartners.
Mrs Vojka Ravbar, Slovenia's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this weekheaded a trade delegation to the UK, said enterprises will have to becomeeven more competitive after privatisation.

A total of 894 cases of sheep encephalopathies or 'scrapie' were diagnosedin 1991, versus just 348 a year-earlier.
However, the government states in afootnote to the table that the reporting of scrapie in sheep has beenencouraged since 1991 'to obtain material for spongiform encephalopathyresearch'.Since 1989, the condition has also been confirmed in 23 cats and 29 goats.
Mr David Maclean, junior agriculture minister, stressed that naturallyoccurring spongiform encephalopathies in species other than cattle were notnotifiable diseases.
He said there was 'insufficient epidemiological data' to 'draw firmconclusions' as to how the disease might have been contracted in cases otherthan scrapie.

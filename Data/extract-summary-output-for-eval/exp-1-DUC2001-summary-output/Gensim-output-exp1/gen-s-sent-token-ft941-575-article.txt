The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a banon British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE).The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legalaction if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officialssaid yesterday.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover foraction against the UK.Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UKafter the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK.
The commissionhas reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and thatthere is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE andCreutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of livecattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected cows.
In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as comingfrom herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.

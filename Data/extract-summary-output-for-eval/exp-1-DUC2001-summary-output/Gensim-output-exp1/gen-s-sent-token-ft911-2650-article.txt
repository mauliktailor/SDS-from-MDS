That is the vexing question facing Mr LewisPreston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takesover as president of the World Bank this September.
The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governmentsof developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the privatesector.
The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr JacquesAttali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attachstrict political conditions to its loans.
Development economists, meanwhile,are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World DevelopmentReport and focus more on poverty alleviation.
Few in Washington now doubt that the bankis needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and theMiddle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems:Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bnpeople live on less than Dollars 1 a day.
What kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr BarberConable?
Mr Conable, a former Republican congressman, arrived at the bank in1986 knowing little about either banking or development.
Although nowwell-liked (partly for championing causes such as women's rights in theThird World), many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky startinvolving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank.
Mr Percy Mistry, a scholar at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, and formersenior adviser at the bank, says it suffered from 'presidential failure'during the 1980s.
Mr Preston's first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control ofthe bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience.
What kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit?
Many Third World countries have gone backwards.
Real percapita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and theMiddle East, and mildly in Latin America.
Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burdenof developing countries' private debts on condition that they implementmarket-oriented economic reforms.'The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries arewilling to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness ofofficial debt.
For most of the1980s, the First World doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness.
Theresult of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of someDollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980.'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,'concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Councilin Washington.
(The IMF was equally short-sighted.)As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies forpromoting development.
Making financeconditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economicperformance of developing countries.
This is bothbecause countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because thebank's policies were sometimes misguided.
Professor John Toye, director ofthe Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, recentlycompleted an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes.
On average programmes have reducedbalance of payments gaps, had a negligible impact on Gross National Productand led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP.Mr Feinberg calls the decline in investment the 'great shortcoming ofstructural adjustment lending in the 1980s'.
(Investment to GNP ratios havefallen markedly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.)
He says thebank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity ofadjustment by increasing investment.
The maturing of bank programmesand the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a markedshrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries.
According to MrLawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the nextfive years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing worldcompared with Dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s.
Some analysts, including US Treasury officials, believe lacklustreperformance in much of the Third World reflects the inefficiency (andsometimes corruption) of governments.
It also says 60 per cent of EBRDresources must be devoted to the commercial sector - private businesses andstate concerns in the process of privatisation.
The World Bank operatesunder very different rules: its charter requires it to be non-political andonly its small affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), canmake direct loans to private businesses.
The EBRD isministering to a region that has historical ties with western Europe andthat has declared its commitment to democracy and free markets.
If strict politicalconditionality had been imposed in the past, the bank could not have lent toa development star such as South Korea.
Mr Flicknerof the Senate Budget Committee says the issue is not whether to insist onWestminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that'loans will benefit the majority of the people'.
Should a significant chunk of the bank's loans be made direct to the privatesector?
He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developingcountries.
In reality, much of the most badly-needed investment is inspheres such as infrastructure, health care and education where governmentsplay a dominant role even in industrialised countries.
Indeed, one conclusion of Prof Toye's analysis is that policy-based loanswould have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expandthe role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promoteeconomic liberalisation.
Sir William Ryrie, the head of the IFC, says the objective of a large volumeof public lending to the private sector is wrong-headed.
Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sectorare surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs;but if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank's judgment of marketrisk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west?There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development.
During the 1980s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums.
Itwanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recentlyfashionable in the industrialised world.
The bank'sown research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directlyand to improve fundamentals, such as education, nutrition and health care.'Liberalisation matters,' says Mr Williamson at the Institute forInternational Economics, 'but education is more important.'
Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that becausedevelopment money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank andother donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.

Introduction:   Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across theopen Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that hasforecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possiblelandfall.
There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead ormissing in a town in Colombia the day before.
``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist atthe National Hurricane Center.
At noon EDT today, Joan's center was near latitude 11.1 northand longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the Colombian coastand about 380 miles east of the island of San Andres off the coastof Nicaragua.
Joan, the Atlantic season's fifth hurricane, is expected tobring 4 to 8 inches of rain along its path.
As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, Joan slowly built itsstrength as it skimmed Colombia's coast, baffling forecasters whohad predicted it to weaken.
Gross said a strong high-pressure system over the northernCaribbean is keeping Joan on its course.
Normally, prevailing windsand upper-level atmospheric conditions push tropical stormsnorthward as they move from the Atlantic, said Gross.
Also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the farsouthern Caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deep-oceanwater to the surface, said Gross.
Joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricaneseason when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct. 11.

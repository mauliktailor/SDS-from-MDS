``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of peoplewho would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annualmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
A number of treatments for AIDSand AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many ofthem are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful,said James Mullins of Stanford University.
But that has changed.``There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,''Mullins said.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that anepidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the innercities.
``We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades ofprogress in our tuberculosis control efforts,'' said Vermund.
``I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to thegeneral population,'' Vermund said.
``It's likely to be yet another health problem imposed on theinner cities, where the health problems are already legion,''Vermund said.
There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis isspreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS,but that is likely, Vermund said.
He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic,probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the1970s.
Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis,Vermund said.

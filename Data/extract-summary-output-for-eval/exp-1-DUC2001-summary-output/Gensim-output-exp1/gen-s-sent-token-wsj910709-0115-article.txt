Judge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson.
A question is which lesson his life best demonstrates.
Some say that he is living proof that in America anything ispossible, and that's true, and some note his rise to eminencedemonstrates again the progress we have made as a nation interms of race, and that's true too.
Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.
His mother loved him.
He got loveand love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that hehad a place at the table.
(The children of the mother oncrack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and painbecause AFDC payments are low; they are so consigned becausecrack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caringand succor.)
Judge Thomas's remind us of thissimple truth.

Introduction:President Bush on Monday nominated Clarence Thomas, a conservative Republicanwith a controversial record on civil rights, to replace retiring JusticeThurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.
If confirmed, the 43-year-oldjudge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would followMarshall as the second black to ascend to the court.
But Thomas, who has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrapconservatism, would present a striking change from Marshall, a civil-rightspioneer and an anchor of the court's declining liberal faction.
While not much is known about Thomas' views on most issues likely to comebefore the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action andto policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.

His views on other major issues before the court, including abortion,church-state relations and the definition of constitutional due process, areunknown.
His position onaffirmative action is probably sufficient to shift the court's direction sincethe court remains closely divided."My opposition to preferences andquotas not only is a constitutional, legal opposition, it has been a moral,ethical opposition," he said five years ago at a conference sponsored by theAnti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
In its most recentaffirmative-action decision, a year ago, the court split 5-4 in upholding aFederal Communications Commission policy that gives preference to blacks andmembers of other minorities in acquiring some radio and television licenses.
Views on big issues unknown; Thomas' views on the other major issues remain unknown, although the 1990confirmation hearing for his seat on the Court of Appeals was widely viewed onCapitol Hill and in ideological interest groups as a rehearsal for a SupremeCourt nomination.
Some Democratic senators said at the time and againMonday that their votes to confirm him for the appeals court should not betaken as endorsements for the Supreme Court.
Three years ago, the Senatedenied confirmation to Judge Robert Bork despite having voted to confirm himonly a few years earlier to the same court on which Thomas now sits.
Leaders of abortion rights groups said Monday that they would press the Senateto deny confirmation to Thomas unless he expresses his support for the SupremeCourt's abortion precedents, including continued adherence to Roe vs.
Abortion faction speaks out"The Souter model of silence and evasion that wesaw last year is absolutely unacceptable," said Kate Michelman, executivedirector of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee, endorsedMichelman's position."I'm through reading tea leaves and voting in thedark," he said.
But the Judiciary Committee includes some of the mostconservative Democrats in the Senate as well several combative Republicanconservatives.
If Thomas maintains his silence, his nomination is unlikely tofounder on the abortion issue alone.
Rights groups cautiousCivil rightsgroups took a cautious tone Monday, essentially noting "concerns" and sayingthey would study the record."We urge the Senate not to rush to judgment,"said a statement from a Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an umbrellagroup of 185 organizations that took an early and leading role in the defeatof the Bork nomination.
Introducing his nominee to the country at atelevised news conference Monday, Bush drew on the powerful appeal of Thomas'life story as a self-motivated and self-made success."Judge Thomas' lifeis a model for all Americans," Bush said.
Wellbefore Bush presented Thomas to the country Monday, it was clear that thatchapter in the court's history is largely closed and that a new page was aboutto be turned.

Introduction:PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within thenext 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes.
He told the National Governors' Association that he was committed to 'endingwelfare as we know it' with measures to finance expanded job training forthe unemployed, matched by a requirement that people must do some kind ofwork for their welfare cheque.
The president said he would focus on better implementation of the FamilySupport Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-forcewhich he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.'The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and theright support systems,' Mr Clinton said.
As a result, fewstates have been able to implement in full the act's requirement thatwelfare recipients take part in some form of education or training.
Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principlethat 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'.
Mr Clinton said he would let states experimentwith such programmes, even when he disagreed with them.

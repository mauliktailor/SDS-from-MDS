GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insuranceclaims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m.'Lord Airlie, the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders'meeting, said: 'On the basis of emerging information, General Accidentadvise that the losses to their US operations arising from Hurricane Andrew,which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at whichexternal catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed'.What this means is that GA is able to pass on its losses to externalreinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached.
The company's loss adjusters are in the area trying to estimate the losses.
Their guess is that losses to be faced by all insurers may total more thanDollars 8bn.
Not all damaged property in the area is insured and there have beenestimates that the storm caused more than Dollars 20bn of damage.
However, other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low asDollars 1bn in total.

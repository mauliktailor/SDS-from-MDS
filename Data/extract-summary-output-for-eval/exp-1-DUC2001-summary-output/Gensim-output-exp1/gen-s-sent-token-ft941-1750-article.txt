However, Washington's proposals, promised by Mr Alexander Watson, assistantsecretary of state for inter-American affairs, are likely to disappointCaribbean basin governments which have been seeking a comprehensive packageto allow free access to the US and Canadian markets.
Claiming that a more competitive Mexico, with free access to the US andCanada, will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developedunder current trade agreements, the region has asked for 'parity' withMexico in exporting to Nafta signatories.
Some regional government officials and US legislators supportive of theCaribbean's concerns - which include the possible diversion of investmentsto Mexico - have now concluded that what would amount to a de factoextension of Nafta is unlikely.
Mr Clinton and his Mexican counterpart, Mr Carlos Salinas, assuredthe Caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected bythe implementation of Nafta, and that efforts would be made to protect theirmarkets in the US and Canada.
What the Caribbean basin countries want is quick action by legislators inWashington, and then in Ottawa and Mexico City, to ratify proposals by someUS congressmen to put all the region's exports to the US and Canada on a parwith Mexico's.
The parity proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean basin countries an opendoor to the Nafta market for three years.
Clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefitsof Nafta are felt by the Caribbean countries,' said Mr Manuel Esquivel,prime minister of Belize.
While willing togive parity to a few products, the US wanted the Caribbean basin countriesto meet new conditions, including bilateral investment treaties,intellectual property rights agreements, workers' rights and environmentallegislation, democracy, good governance and accountability, Mr Carringtonsaid.'The costs of parity are much higher than we anticipated and any thoughts offull membership of Nafta are as far down the road as they ever were.'In presenting their case for parity, Caribbean leaders have argued that theUS and Canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economicdislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to Mexico.
Mr P JPatterson, Jamaica's prime minister, claimed that many jobs in the USdepended on trade flows between that country and the Caribbean region.'Each Dollars 1bn of US exports to the region creates 20,000 new jobs in theUS,' he said.
This is why we must pursue efforts to ensure that thequestion of the granting of parity be given early and positiveconsideration.'Without improved access to the US and Canadian markets to counter Mexico'sbenefits under Nafta, the Caribbean basin countries will have to continuedepending on their current trade preference agreements with the US andCanada.
The benefits from these were diminishing, said Mr Carrington, as theregion's exports became less competitive and Mexican products enjoyed thebenefits of the market.'The Nafta playing field will never be level for the region,' he said.'Nobody is going to give us an even playing field, but we have to work tomake it less uneven.'

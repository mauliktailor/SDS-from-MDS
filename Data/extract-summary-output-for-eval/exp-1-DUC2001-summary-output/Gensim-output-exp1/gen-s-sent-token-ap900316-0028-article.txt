A steady decline in tuberculosis has all butstopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected,federal health researchers say.
In 1988, the last year for which complete statistics areavailable, 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported, down 0.4percent from 1987, the national Centers for Disease Controlreported Thursday.
If the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up throughthe late 1980s, an estimated 14,768 fewer TB cases would have beenexpected during 1985-1988, the CDC said in its weekly report.
Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, ascompared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higherrates of AIDS cases.
In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites,compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics.
The TB rateamong blacks was 28.3 per 100,000, compared with 18.3 for Hispanicsand 4.1 for whites.
The CDC estimates that 10 million Americans are infected withthe bacteria that cause tuberculosis, an infection of the lungs.
But the number of new cases is only part of the toll fromtuberculosis, the CDC said.

A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census isresolved with the decision to include military personnel stationedoverseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep countingillegal aliens.
But the question still may be raised in committee andin the Senate.
The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of Housemembers from states where slow growth threatens to result in lossesof House seats.
While aliens have been counted in the past, military personnelstationed overseas have not.
The problem has been in deciding which states may count thesepeople as residents.
The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both incommittee and on the House floor.
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban oncounting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 millionto run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year,including $800 million to take the census.
The bill was approved258-165 and sent to the Senate.
Opponents noted the Constitution requires House seats to beapportioned based on all the ``persons'' residing in a state.
``Every census since the Constitution was created has countedall residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really overpopulation shifts that will lead to more House seats for southernand western states.
Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., said, however, that counting illegalaliens ``is not fair.
Asking people about their status likely wouldresult in people lying or refusing to participate in the count,officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of residents inmany areas.

The tuberculosis rate in U.S. prisons may be morethan three times higher than on the outside, federal healthofficials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and othermeasures to curb TB behind bars.
``In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB hasincreased dramatically,'' the CDC said, noting that in New Yorkstate there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seventimes more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78.
In New Jersey, inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987,11 times higher than the general New Jersey population.
The CDC's Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosisis recommending TB testing for most new prison inmates and staffmembers _ with the possible exception of inmates just transferringthrough for less than a week.
The CDC committee also recommends new tests at least once ayear, rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms,and isolation _ off the prison property, if necessary _ for thosewith suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB cases.
The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in thespread of TB in prisons, the CDC said.
AIDS tests should be offered to all inmates with known TBinfections, the CDC report said.

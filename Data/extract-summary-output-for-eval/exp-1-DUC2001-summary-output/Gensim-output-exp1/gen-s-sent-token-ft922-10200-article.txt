LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one ofthe most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack forfuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor blackneighbourhoods.
Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed bythe scale of the violence.
That the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by theriots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on Mr Gates'sreputation.
But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removalunder a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and MrGates has developed political clout on top of this job security.
President George Bush last year called Mr Gates 'an exemplary police chief,'although at the time he called the conduct of the four Los Angeles officers -whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggeredthis week's protests and violence - 'sickening' and 'outrageous'.A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under thechairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretaryof state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, interms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates theofficer from the community'.Besides recommending that Mr Gates should go, the Christopher commissionurged a policy of community policing with more foot patrols, as well asmeasures to discipline racist police officers and to improve theinvestigation of complaints about police brutality.
The commission found that a significant minority of the Los Angeles policeforce 'repetitively misuse force' without being properly disciplined.
His replacement, Mr WillieWilliams, will be the first black head of the Los Angeles force.

The winner was 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, whooutsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient, calculating race.
Running alone about 200 meters behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passedthem all by 21 miles and went on to win in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, thesecond-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob deCastella in 1986.Ikangaa finished a distant second in 2:09:52.
It was histhird consecutive runner-up finish in Boston.

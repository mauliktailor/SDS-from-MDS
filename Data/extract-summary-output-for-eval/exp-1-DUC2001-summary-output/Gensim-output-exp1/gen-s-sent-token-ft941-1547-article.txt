The German government yesterday announced the launch of a new researchproject to examine whether the cattle disease bovine spongiformencephalopathy (BSE) can be transmitted to human beings.
The initiative comes as the country is pushing for a European Union ban onBritish beef imports, arguing that there is still no conclusive evidencethat the disease cannot affect humans.
Several German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly knownas 'mad cow disease' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle -may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicinesmade with ingredients from contaminated animals.'The danger that BSE can be transmitted to humans is minimal ornon-existent,' said Professor Hans Kretzschmar from Gottingen University.'However
The research ministry said that more than 100,000 cattle had died as aresult of catching BSE in Britain.
A further 50 cases of the disease hadbeen recorded in Switzerland and there were two known cases in Germany, oneof which affected a cow imported from Britain.

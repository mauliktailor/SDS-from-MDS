Introduction:The names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of Hugo and Gilbert may be prowling the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the future.
"The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s," says meteorologist William M.
Gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought.
The most intense hurricanes, Gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from Africa.
The atmospheric pressure at its center drops drastically and its wind speed exceeds 155 m.p.h. In the drier 17-year period of 1970 to 1987, there were only 13 severe storms.
Last year's Gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across Jamaica and the Mexican Yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere.
Officially a 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it "may be a borderline 5," says meteorologist Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars.
Fortunately, most Atlantic-region hurricanes do not develop to their worst potential.
If the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions, there is a good probability of the return of stronger storms," Gray said.
The threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
To develop, they need tropical ocean-surface temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will," Emanuel explains.
The biggest uncertainty, he says, is whether global warming will affect tropical ocean temperatures.

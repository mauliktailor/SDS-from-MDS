The proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of theRepublican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospectiveDemocratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and mostof the Democratic leadership in Congress.
His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that PresidentBush's support for Nafta is a winning issue.
Although many working classHispanic Americans believe Nafta would cost jobs, the Latino businessorganisations cautiously support the pact.
Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congressto vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Naftaapproved by Congress this year.
Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executivedirector of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as aweapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs toMexico.
A centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to theCongress in May 1991, in which he committed himself to action onenvironmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if theydon't send a complete package in these three areas, the CongressionalDemocrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn'tmatter,' said Mr Freeman.
Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared itsground well in the House.
There is a new awareness of its costs and that has come backto their representatives in Washington.'In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator DonRiegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas.'If the Riegle resolution gets through,' said one business lobbyist, 'wemight as well kiss Nafta goodbye.'

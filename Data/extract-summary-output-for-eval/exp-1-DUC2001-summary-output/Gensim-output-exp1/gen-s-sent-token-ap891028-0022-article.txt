A major earthquake registering 7.2 on theRichter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today,the U.S. Geological Survey says.
The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17.
Majorearthquakes in the Solomons usually don't cause much damage or manycasualties because the area is sparsely populated and notextensively developed.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said noPacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ wasgenerated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes insea levels.
An 8.3 quake hit the Macquarie Islands southof Australia on May 23.
The survey's earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said earlyseismograph readings placed the epicenter of Saturday's earthquakeabout 200 miles southeast of Honiaria, which is on GuadacanalIsland and is the capital of the Solomons.
That places the earthquake just east of San Cristobal, theeasternmost island in the Solomons chain and about 1,300 milesnortheast of Brisbane, Australia.
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,6 severe damage.
A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable ofwidespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable oftremendous damage.

The focus of the drought plaguing much of thenation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for mostareas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday.
The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot,dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the OhioValley to the Mid-Atlantic states.
Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the GreatLakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency'sClimate Analysis Center reported.
In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of thenorthern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.
At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation wasundergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.
The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloudover that assumption.
The drought region now extends well into West Virginia andincludes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky andTennessee, the weather service drought advisory said.
However, in the Midwest, theweather service reported that large areas have experienced thedriest April-June period on record since 1895.
Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation,however, the weather service noted.
In addition to Thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-rangeoutlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remainhotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lowerMidwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies andGreat Basin.
Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward fromTexas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.

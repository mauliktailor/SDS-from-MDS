A 1987 state constitutional amendmentbroadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felonsmay own guns, a judge ruled.
Perkins onFriday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felonagainst Edward Brown of Cumberland.
``If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict orqualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted aconstitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions,''Perkins wrote.
``Maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the mostbroad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar stateamendments,'' he wrote.
The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep andbear arms ``for the common defense.''
In 1986, the Maine Supreme Court upheld a gun violation byfocusing on the ``common defense'' phrase.
Brown had been accused of criminal threatening in 1988, as wellas with illegal possession of a gun.
Perkins denied a motion to dismiss the criminal threateningcharge, but threw out the gun possession charge, saying ``there issimply no rational connection'' between Brown's previous convictionand his ownership of a firearm.
